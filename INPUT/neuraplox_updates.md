# NeuraPlox / Neurawork — Updated Company Information (February 2026)

IMPORTANT: This document contains CORRECTIONS and ADDITIONS to the original Antrag_v9.pdf. Where information conflicts, THIS document takes precedence.

## Company Facts — CORRECTIONS

- **Team size:** 4-5 engineers (NOT 15 employees). Lean team, capital-efficient.
- **Founding team:** Christoph Knoell (CEO — Product, Strategy & Technology) and Sylvia Knoell (Managing Director — Operations & Finance). Husband-wife founding duo.
- **Revenue:** >EUR 2M in year two, bootstrapped. Entirely from consulting/services revenue.
- **Funding stage:** Seed. Raising EUR 3M (NOT EUR 2M).
- **Round framing:** With revenue already sustaining the team and operations, the Seed goes directly into product and engineering — not into keeping the lights on.
- **Product status:** Architectural foundation is built, key components validated in live projects. The full 7-layer platform is NOT finished — it is what the Seed funds. Early stage, clear vision, validated architecture.

## Narrative — CRITICAL REFRAME: Demand-First, Not Tech-First

The entire deck narrative MUST reflect this origin story:

1. Neurawork started as an AI consulting company — NOT as a technology startup looking for use cases.
2. Over two years, the team built and deployed AI systems across 25+ enterprise projects in the Mittelstand.
3. Every engagement confirmed the same pattern: companies fail at infrastructure, not at ambition or use cases.
4. From this deep, hands-on experience inside real enterprises, the team now knows EXACTLY what infrastructure the Mittelstand needs.
5. NeuraPlox is the product born from that demand — not from a technology hypothesis.

The team is technically strong AND demand-driven. Not one or the other. The starting point was always real enterprise needs, but they have the engineering depth to build the solution.

Key line: "Not starting from technology looking for a use case, but solving real operational problems and building the tech to match."

SAP analogy: "What SAP did for business processes, NeuraPlox will do for AI agents." (Use "will do" — product is being built, not finished.)

## New Strategic Concepts for the Deck

### 1. Operational AI — The Delivery Model (50% Tech, 50% Human)

Neurawork's methodology "Operational AI" brings AI from idea to daily production operations via three equal pillars:
- **AI Strategy** — From use case to roadmap
- **AI Architecture & Operations** — NeuraPlox as technical foundation
- **Training / Change / Communication** — Bringing people along, building competence

The critical insight: 50% technology, 50% human. AI that doesn't run in daily operations is not a result. Learned from 100+ projects in 2025 — most companies fail not at technology but because strategy, architecture, or change management is missing.

### 2. Operations as a Service — The Real Revenue Driver

Neurawork doesn't just deploy the platform — it OPERATES AI agents for customers: monitoring, optimization, compliance, continuous operations (Phase 6 in the model). This creates recurring, predictable revenue with high retention.

**Shopify analogy (strong for investors):**
Shopify earns ~75% of its revenue NOT from software subscriptions but from Merchant Solutions (payments, fulfillment, operations). Q3 2025: $2.1B Merchant Solutions vs. $699M Subscriptions. NeuraPlox is the platform; Operations as a Service is our Merchant Solutions.

**Stripe analogy:**
Just as Stripe abstracted the complexity of payment infrastructure — without hiding it — NeuraPlox abstracts the complexity of AI infrastructure. The IT director doesn't need to be a Kubernetes expert, but they understand that their agents run on it and why. No black-box approach — infrastructure that builds competence instead of creating dependency.

### 3. Agent Marketplace — Third-Party Agents as New Commerce

NeuraPlox will become a marketplace where third-party agents are distributed to enterprises. External developers, consultancies, and industry experts build specialized agents and sell them via the platform to SMEs.

Why this matters for investors:
- **Platform economics:** NeuraPlox evolves from product to ecosystem. Like Salesforce AppExchange or Shopify App Store — but for AI agents.
- **Network effects:** More agents attract more enterprises, more enterprises attract more agent developers. Classic flywheel.
- **Revenue share / take rate:** NeuraPlox earns from every agent transaction (commission, subscription split). Recurring revenue without own delivery.
- **Future of commerce:** Companies no longer buy software licenses or consulting days — they buy agents that generate value immediately. The next stage after SaaS: Agent-as-a-Service.

### 4. Prism Agents — Replacing Entire Consulting Verticals

The "Agents of Prism" concept: specialized, composable agents that don't assist humans — they replace entire job functions currently staffed by expensive consultants:
- **Analytics Agents** — Real-time BI replacing management consulting analytics (McKinsey-grade insight at platform cost)
- **Marketing Agents** — Strategy + execution replacing the EUR 10K/month agency retainer
- **Sales Agents** — Pipeline analytics, deal coaching replacing sales consultancy
- **Contract Development Agents** — Automated drafting, compliance checking replacing outside legal counsel

Key investor insight: Each agent category is a consulting vertical being collapsed into a software subscription. The TAM isn't "AI tools" — it's the consulting and professional services market being eaten by agents.

### 5. Anti-"Sweet Poison" — Openness as Strategic Advantage

Companies that consume AI only as chat tools (Langdock & Co.) build no internal know-how — "sweet poison." Neurawork's conviction: First infrastructure and competence, then abstraction.

NeuraPlox provides the technical foundation. After that, three paths:
- **Build further yourself** (open, no lock-in)
- **Neurawork operates** (Operations as a Service)
- **Third parties take over** (proven to work, strengthens ecosystem)

For investors: Openness sounds like risk but is actually the retention driver. Those who build on NeuraPlox and develop competence don't leave — precisely because they COULD. This is the AWS playbook: no lock-in, yet everyone stays.

### 6. Three-Horizon Business Model

- **Horizon 1 (now):** Consulting/Services — 30% gross margin, EUR 2M+ revenue, validates demand
- **Horizon 2 (Seed build):** SaaS Platform (NeuraPlox) — 70% gross margin, EUR 24K-60K ACV
- **Horizon 3 (scale):** Marketplace + Operations as a Service — 80%+ gross margin, platform economics

The consulting business is not a liability — it's the demand validation engine and customer acquisition channel for the platform.

## CRITICAL STRATEGIC REFRAME: Global Positioning — Away from "Mittelstand" Framing

THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE IN THIS GENERATION.

The ENTIRE positioning must be global, NOT German/European-centric. The target customer is NOT "Mittelstand" companies in the classic German sense. The target is companies WORLDWIDE of a certain size that share these characteristics:

1. **Can decide fast** — no long enterprise procurement cycles
2. **Have budget** — not bootstrapped startups, but also not Fortune 500 overhead
3. **Are action-capable** — agile decision structures, not corporate bureaucracy

These companies exist everywhere: DACH, US, UK, Nordics, APAC.

**Rules for the deck:**
- Use "Mittelstand" ONLY as a proof-of-traction reference (where we come from, what we've delivered) — NOT as the target market definition
- The VISION is global: NeuraPlox as the Agent OS for fast-growing, decision-capable companies — regardless of whether they're in Germany, the US, the UK, or Asia
- Replace "German SMEs" / "Mittelstand" / "European enterprises" with language like: "mid-market companies", "growth-stage enterprises", "companies with 50-500 employees"
- DACH is the beachhead with proven traction. The product is designed to be global from day one: cloud-agnostic, model-agnostic, compliance-layer configurable per jurisdiction
- The EU AI Act is an ACCELERATOR in Europe, not a market limiter. In the US and APAC, the value proposition is security + operational control for AI agents (which is universally needed, not regulation-dependent)

**Global winner pathway (required by Earlybird):**
- Phase 1 (Year 1-2): DACH beachhead — proven traction, direct sales + consulting pipeline
- Phase 2 (Year 2-3): EU expansion — EU AI Act creates uniform demand across 27 member states. Channel partners in Netherlands, France, Nordics. Zero product localization needed.
- Phase 3 (Year 3+): US + UK + APAC — The Agent Marketplace creates supply-side pull globally. Third-party developers anywhere can build agents for the marketplace, pulling their local enterprise customers onto the platform. The security value proposition (not compliance) is the universal sell.
- Open-source L1-L3 layers create a global developer community. Proprietary L4-L7 monetizes that community. This is the global scaling mechanism.

**Market sizing must reflect this:**
- DACH SAM: EUR 1.5B (proven, bottom-up) — this is the beachhead, not the ceiling
- EU-27 SAM: EUR 10B+ (same platform, same compliance layer, 27 countries)
- Global TAM for AI infrastructure/platform: EUR 94B by 2030 (MarketsandMarkets)
- The narrative should show: small beachhead with proof → large adjacent market with zero friction → massive global opportunity

## VALIDATION FIXES — MUST BE ADDRESSED

### Fix 1: Burn Rate Transparency

The deck MUST include a burn rate figure or credible framing. Since exact monthly burn is not in source documents, use this framing:
- "Current monthly operating cost is approximately EUR 80-100K (team of ~10 including engineers + consultants). Revenue of >EUR 2M/year (~EUR 170K/month) means the company is operationally cash-flow positive."
- "Burn multiple on consulting business is effectively 0 — revenue exceeds costs."
- "Post-Seed projected burn: EUR 120-150K/month with expanded engineering team. At EUR 3M raised, this provides 20-24 months runway — PLUS ongoing consulting revenue as cash cushion."
- Flag in speaker notes: exact P&L available in data room.

### Fix 2: Quantified Customer ROI Evidence + Named Customers

Include aggregated customer evidence:
- "Across 25+ enterprise AI deployments, infrastructure consistently consumed ~60% of total project budget when built from scratch. NeuraPlox architecture components reduced this to <30% in pilot environments — saving an average of EUR 45-75K per project."
- "Deployment time baseline across projects: 3-6 months for custom infrastructure. NeuraPlox target: <6 weeks — a 4-5x acceleration validated in 4 active pilot environments."
- Frame as: "These are not projections — they are measurements from real engagements."

Named customers (can be used in traction slide):
- Eventos
- Falkensteg
- Kalkül
- Primus
- Valor

These are REAL customer names. Use them as logo evidence on the traction slide. This is strong proof — named logos are much more credible than anonymized references.

### Fix 3: Team Scaling Plan + Advisory Board

Post-Seed planned hires:
- 2-3 senior engineers (platform build completion)
- 1 sales/partnerships lead (channel activation)
- Frame: "EUR 2M revenue with 4-5 engineers is exceptional output-per-headcount. The Seed funds targeted scaling, not a hiring spree."

Advisory Board (CONFIRMED — use real names):
- Thorsten Koch — Senior Partner Technical Advisor, Google Cloud. Built and led the Customer Engineering team for Google Cloud in Central Eastern Europe. Based in Vienna. Deep expertise in cloud infrastructure, enterprise AI adoption, and scaling technical teams across regulated European markets.
- Mario Berger — Google Country Manager Austria / Field Engineering Manager, Google Cloud. MBA International Management. Enterprise cloud sales and go-to-market expertise at Google scale.

Both advisors bring Google-level cloud infrastructure and enterprise sales credibility. This is critical for the global positioning: NeuraPlox has Google Cloud leadership advising on architecture and GTM — not just a German consulting team.

### Fix 4: NDR Proxy from Consulting

Since the platform is pre-launch, use consulting repeat/expansion data as NDR proxy:
- Named customers (Eventos, Falkensteg, Kalkül, Primus, Valor) represent the active client base.
- If any of these are repeat customers (multiple engagements) or expanded scope over time, state: "X of 5 named clients engaged for multiple projects — indicating strong retention and expansion potential that will translate to platform NDR."
- Even without exact NDR: "100% of pilot customers came from existing consulting relationships — zero cold acquisition. This consulting-to-platform conversion path is the strongest possible NDR signal at pre-product stage."

### Fix 5: Word Limit Compliance — STRICT

ALL slides MUST stay within their word limits. This is a hard constraint:
- cover: 30 words max
- executive-summary: 100 words max
- problem: 120 words max
- why-now: 120 words max
- solution: 150 words max
- product: 150 words max
- market-sizing: 120 words max
- business-model: 130 words max
- traction: 130 words max
- go-to-market: 130 words max
- competitive-landscape: 120 words max
- team: 150 words max
- financials: 120 words max
- the-ask: 130 words max
- ai-architecture: 150 words max

Count words carefully. If a slide exceeds its limit, remove the least important bullet or shorten phrasing. Do NOT exceed these limits.

## CRITICAL NARRATIVE REFRAME: Security First, Not Governance First

IMPORTANT: The deck currently over-emphasizes governance and compliance (DSGVO, EU AI Act) as the primary value proposition. This is WRONG as the lead framing.

The PRIMARY value proposition is: **Operational Security for AI** — enterprises can run AI agents in production without risking their business operations through security breaches, data leaks, or uncontrolled agent behavior.

The correct framing hierarchy:
1. **Security** — Your AI agents cannot compromise your business. No security breaches, no data exfiltration, no uncontrolled agent actions. This is about keeping the business running safely.
2. **Governance** — Full visibility and control over what agents do, what data they access, who authorized them. This is about operational control.
3. **Compliance (DSGVO, EU AI Act)** — Regulatory compliance is a RESULT of having security and governance right. It's an important benefit but NOT the lead message.

The investor pitch should NOT lead with "EU AI Act compliant" — it should lead with "your AI agents are operationally safe and secure." Compliance follows naturally from that.

Think of it like this: You don't buy a firewall because of DSGVO. You buy a firewall because you don't want your business to get hacked. DSGVO compliance is a side effect of good security. Same logic applies here: NeuraPlox keeps your AI operations secure. EU AI Act compliance is a side effect of that security architecture.

The 3D Policy Model (Who x What x Which Data) is fundamentally a SECURITY model that also happens to satisfy compliance requirements. Frame it that way.
