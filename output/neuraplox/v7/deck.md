## Narrative Arc
NeuraPlox opens with a category-creation hook — the Agent OS that Europe's Mittelstand needs. We establish urgent structural pain (PoC graveyard, N×M integration tax, regulatory deadline), then reveal the resolution: an OS-layer where agents auto-create connectors and governance is architecturally embedded. We prove it with 25+ real projects, ZIM validation, and four live pilot cases. We quantify a defensible €1.5B DACH SAM, show a 30%→70%→80%+ gross margin trajectory, and close with a capital-efficient €2M ask that funds the platform transition — positioning NeuraPlox as Europe's sovereign infrastructure bet for the agent era.

<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Open with the one-liner and let it land: 'We are building the operating system that every enterprise will run their AI agents on.' Do not over-explain on this slide. The subtitle — governance-safe by design — signals immediately that we solve the production deployment problem, not just the demo problem. The SAP-era framing sets category ambition before the first slide turn.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: 'Agent OS' as a new category mirrors how UiPath named RPA and remberg named XRM — Earlybird's hallmark investment pattern; European digital sovereignty: company name, founding location, and subtitle all signal European-first infrastructure; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: governance-safe framing signals applied AI, not pure research

*Transition: Before we show you what the OS looks like, let us show you exactly why enterprises cannot get AI into production without it.*

---

## Slide 2: SAP for the AI Era — One OS, Any Agent, Any System
*Type: executive-summary*

**NeuraPlox eliminates the N×M integration tax and makes AI agents production-safe — the missing infrastructure layer for Europe's 70,000 Mittelstand companies.**

- 🏗️ CATEGORY: Agent OS — not an AI tool, the infrastructure layer that runs all AI tools. Complexity reduced from N×M integrations to N+M.
- 🔒 MOAT: Proprietary 3D-Policy governance (WHO × WHAT × WHICH DATA) — the only agent-centric compliance architecture built for EU AI Act. Governance is the unlock to production.
- 📊 TRACTION: 25+ enterprise KI projects delivered, 15-person team bootstrapped in 2 years, ZIM grant of €237,375 secured (TRL 4→7). Four pilot customers validating core architecture with real data.
- 💶 BUSINESS: Consulting (30% GM) → Platform SaaS €24K–96K ACV (70% GM) → Marketplace (80%+ GM). Year 3 target: €3M ARR, 50 customers. €2M Seed raise now open.

**Key Metrics:**
- 25+ enterprise projects delivered
- €237,375 ZIM grant (45% R&D co-funded)
- Target ACV: €24K–€60K | Year 3 SOM: €3M ARR

This is your 30-second filter slide — investors should be able to reconstruct the full thesis from this one page. Lead with the SAP analogy: SAP unified fragmented enterprise operations; NeuraPlox unifies fragmented AI agents. Emphasize that the governance layer is not a feature — it is the moat. The ZIM grant is a credibility signal: Germany's innovation agency has already validated the technology. Close with the business model trajectory to show you understand the path from services to software economics.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: explicit SAP analogy positions this as a new market category, not a feature; Capital-efficient growth: ZIM grant covers 45% of core R&D — government-validated and co-funded; AI as infrastructure not veneer: N+M framing shows proprietary architectural moat, not wrapper; European digital sovereignty: Mittelstand focus, German grant, EU AI Act compliance as product feature

*Transition: To understand why this OS is necessary, you need to see exactly how broken the current situation is for every enterprise trying to deploy AI agents.*

---

## Slide 3: Enterprise AI is Stuck Between PoC and Production
*Type: problem*

**The Mittelstand is willing and able — but structurally blocked. Three compounding failures are creating a €1.5B infrastructure gap.**

- ⚙️ THE N×M TAX: Every agent needs custom connections to every data source. 3 agents × 5 sources = 15 bespoke integrations. 60% of KI project costs go to redundant infrastructure — not value creation. 63% of KMU report cost overruns averaging 34% (maximal.digital 2025).
- 🔓 NO GOVERNANCE = NO DEPLOYMENT: 73% of enterprises report inadequate control over AI agent activities (Langflow/DataStax 2025). 47% already use generative AI — but without a governance framework. Agents in production without governance are a liability, not an asset.
- 🔒 VENDOR LOCK-IN TRAP: Hyperscalers offer vertical stacks where switching providers is architecturally prohibited. Enterprise platforms (Palantir €150K+/yr, Dataiku €48K+/yr) are priced out of the Mittelstand. Agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI) are developer libraries — no deployment, no governance, no production path.
- ⏰ REGULATORY DEADLINE: EU AI Act mandatory governance requirements for high-risk systems take effect August 2026. Ad-hoc implementations cannot meet compliance. 86% of KMU recognize AI's strategic relevance — only 23% have successfully operationalized it (maximal.digital 2025).

**Key Metrics:**
- 86% of KMU recognize AI strategic relevance — only 23% operationalized (maximal.digital 2025)
- 73% of enterprises: inadequate AI agent governance (Langflow/DataStax 2025)
- 60% of KI project costs: redundant infrastructure, not value creation

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Frame this as structural failure, not a skills gap. The Mittelstand is not failing because it lacks ambition — it lacks architecture. The N×M problem is combinatorially explosive: it compounds with every new agent and data source, which is why point solutions cannot solve it. The governance problem is existential: without it, nothing goes to production. The regulatory clock makes this urgent — August 2026 is not far away, and ad-hoc implementations will not be compliant. Every consulting project we run confirms this: enterprises are buying consultants to solve an infrastructure problem that should be solved by a platform.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: European digital sovereignty: US lock-in pain (hyperscaler vendor trap) is a direct sovereignty concern for German enterprises; AI as infrastructure not veneer: the PoC graveyard framing validates that AI needs real infrastructure, not more demos; Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: data sourced from German-specific market research (Bitkom, maximal.digital, Horvath)

*Transition: Three forces have converged in 2025 to make this the exact right moment to build the Agent OS — and we have been operating inside the problem long enough to know exactly what it needs.*

---

## Slide 4: Three Forces Converge — The Agent OS Window is Open Now
*Type: why-now*

**Regulatory pressure, technology readiness, and proven market demand have aligned to create a 12-18 month category-creation window.**

- ⚡ REGULATORY CATALYST — EU AI Act August 2026: Mandatory governance for high-risk AI systems creates a hard compliance deadline. 56% of enterprises see the AI Act as a burden without a solution (Bitkom 2025). NeuraPlox turns compliance from a blocker into a built-in feature — the only agent platform with EU AI Act governance by design.
- 📉 TECHNOLOGY READINESS — LLM Cost Collapse: GPT-4 class inference costs have dropped 90%+ since 2023, making agent-based automation economically viable for Mittelstand workflows. Gartner: 40%+ of enterprise applications will contain embedded AI agents by 2026. The infrastructure to run them safely does not yet exist at scale.
- 🔬 DEMAND SIGNAL — 25+ Consulting Projects as Market Proof: Every consulting engagement we win is a customer paying us to solve an infrastructure problem that should be solved by a platform. This is not hypothetical demand — enterprises are already spending €80K–€150K per project on infrastructure that NeuraPlox standardizes once.
- 🌍 SOVEREIGNTY TAILWIND — European AI Infrastructure: BMWK is investing €5B+ in AI and digital sovereignty (SOOFI, GAIA-X, IPCEI). 93% of German companies prefer German AI providers (Bitkom 2025). The political and procurement environment actively favors a sovereign European Agent OS.

**Key Metrics:**
- EU AI Act compliance mandatory: August 2026
- Gartner: 40%+ enterprise apps with embedded agents by 2026
- 93% of German companies prefer German AI providers (Bitkom 2025)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The why-now argument has three mutually reinforcing forces — regulatory, technological, and demand — plus a sovereignty tailwind that is unique to a European player. Stress that the LLM cost collapse has made agents economically viable but has NOT created the infrastructure to run them safely at enterprise scale. That infrastructure gap is exactly what NeuraPlox fills. The consulting traction is the most credible demand signal available at this stage: real enterprises paying real money to solve exactly the problem NeuraPlox platforms. The August 2026 AI Act deadline creates urgency that shortens sales cycles.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: explicit timing argument for why the Agent OS category is being created now; European digital sovereignty: BMWK investment and German provider preference create structural moat; AI as infrastructure not veneer: regulatory catalyst transforms governance from optional to mandatory infrastructure; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: technology readiness (LLM cost curves) validates now as the commercialization moment

*Transition: So what does the solution actually look like? It is an OS architecture where agents declare intent, the platform resolves connections automatically, and governance gates every action before it executes.*

---

## Slide 5: N+M Architecture: Agents Connect to Any System Automatically
*Type: solution*

**NeuraPlox is the AI Operating System where agents auto-create their own IT interfaces — reducing N×M integration complexity to N+M, with governance gating every action.**

- 🔄 HOW IT WORKS: Agents (Ploxe) declare intent → Unified Data Access Layer (L5) resolves connectors automatically → Policy & Governance Engine (L6) gates execution → every action traced end-to-end via Observability (L4). No custom integrations per agent-source pair.
- ⚡ THE N+M BREAKTHROUGH: Traditional approach: N agents × M data sources = N×M integrations (3 agents, 5 sources = 15 custom connections). NeuraPlox: N agents + M data sources = N+M connections. Microsoft 365, SAP, DMS — 3 core connectors cover 80% of Mittelstand data needs.
- 🔒 GOVERNANCE AS PRODUCTION UNLOCK: 3D-Policy Model — WHO (which agent) × WHAT (which actions) × WHICH DATA (which categories). Every agent is a first-class identity with its own permission matrix, lifecycle status, and audit trail. EU AI Act Art. 9/12/14 compliant by architecture, not by documentation.
- 📈 QUANTIFIED IMPACT: Infrastructure cost share reduced from ~60% to <30% of project cost. Implementation time: 3–6 months → <6 weeks. Cost vs. Palantir: factor 6–10× cheaper at entry (€24K vs. €150K+/year). Bidirectional data access (read AND write) — unlike analytics-only platforms.
- 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL MOAT: As AI models commoditize, the integration + governance layer becomes MORE valuable. Every new agent makes every connector more valuable. Every new connector makes every agent more capable. Network effects are architectural, not just commercial.

**Key Metrics:**
- Infrastructure cost: 60% → <30% of project cost
- Implementation time: 3–6 months → <6 weeks
- Entry ACV: €24K/year vs. Palantir €150K+/year (6–10× cheaper)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Resist the urge to walk through the 7-layer architecture — investors need to understand what it DOES, not how it is built. The N+M metaphor is the most powerful concept in the deck: make the investor feel the combinatorial explosion of N×M, then show the elegance of N+M. The governance angle is the production unlock — no enterprise will deploy agents in production without it, and no other platform has agent-centric governance built in. The AI commoditization rebuttal is critical for sophisticated investors: as models become cheaper and interchangeable, the proprietary infrastructure that makes any model enterprise-safe becomes MORE defensible.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: AI as infrastructure not veneer: N+M architecture is proprietary data and integration moat; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: architectural network effects create defensible position; Capital-efficient growth: 6× cheaper than Palantir positions NeuraPlox in a defensible price band; European digital sovereignty: data stays in European cloud or on-premise by design

*Transition: The governance layer is not just a compliance feature — it is a proprietary architectural moat that no existing platform, framework, or hyperscaler has built. Let us go deeper on why.*

---

## Slide 6: Governance by Design — The 3D-Policy Moat No One Else Has
*Type: product*

**NeuraPlox treats every AI agent as a first-class identity with its own permission matrix — the only platform where agents are governed, not just monitored.**

- 🏛️ 3D-POLICY MODEL (PROPRIETARY): Three dimensions no other governance tool addresses simultaneously — WHO (agent identity, lifecycle status, certification tier) × WHAT (read/write data, LLM calls, inter-agent communication) × WHICH DATA (categories, granularity, PII classification). Goes beyond RBAC — agents are autonomous actors requiring context-dependent, real-time policy enforcement.
- 🔍 END-TO-END AUDIT TRAIL: Every agent action traced via OpenTelemetry across all 7 layers. 100% trace coverage — Prompt Firewall (pre-LLM) + Output Control (post-LLM) + PII detection targeting >95% precision/recall on German business documents. Compliance dashboards for EU AI Act Art. 9 (risk management), Art. 12 (logging), Art. 14 (human oversight).
- 🔌 UNIFIED DATA ACCESS (L5): Bidirectional connector framework for Microsoft 365, SAP, and DMS systems — covers 80% of Mittelstand data needs. Schema-mapping layer in declarative YAML — new connectors without code changes. Unlike analytics-only platforms: agents can read AND write to source systems.
- 🤖 AGENT REGISTRY (L7): Central directory with lifecycle management (Draft→Staging→Production→Deprecated), individual permission matrices, and three-tier certification (Basic/Verified/Certified) for third-party Ploxe. Open SDK enables ISVs and system integrators to build on the platform.
- 🛡️ IP PROTECTION: Control Plane (L4–L7) is proprietary software protected as trade secret. Execution Layer (L1–L3) open-sourced for community adoption. Patent application for agent-centric identity governance architecture planned post-TRL 7. NeuraPlox trademark filed at DPMA.

**Key Metrics:**
- PII detection target: >95% precision and >95% recall on German business documents
- Policy evaluation latency target: <2 seconds for full 4-stage pipeline
- 3-tier agent certification framework — unique in market

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

This is the moat slide. The 3D-Policy Model is the single most defensible piece of IP in the stack — no agent framework, no enterprise platform, and no hyperscaler has built agent-as-identity governance. NeMo Guardrails does input/output filtering; we do agent identity governance. That is a categorically different abstraction. The bidirectionality of L5 is also a key differentiator — analytics platforms like Palantir and Dataiku read data; NeuraPlox agents read AND write, which is required for actual workflow automation. The open/closed IP strategy is deliberate: open the infrastructure to attract developers, close the governance layer where the moat lives.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: AI as infrastructure not veneer: proprietary 3D-Policy Model is architectural moat, not a feature wrapper; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: specific TRL milestones, ISO certifications, patent strategy; European digital sovereignty: DSGVO-compliant PII detection by design, data stays in EU infrastructure; Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: EU AI Act article-specific compliance (Art. 9, 12, 14) shows regulatory depth

*Transition: Now that you understand what the platform does and why it is defensible, let us size the market it is going after — and show why this is a category creation moment, not just a niche opportunity.*

## Slide 7: Creating the Agent OS Category — €1.5B DACH SAM
*Type: market-sizing*

**Bottom-up: 70,000 Mittelstand ICPs × 45% AI adoption by 2027 = 30,000 addressable companies. SOM Year 3 is <0.2% of SAM — deliberately conservative.**

- 📐 BOTTOM-UP METHODOLOGY: ICP = Mittelstand companies, 50–500 employees, DACH region (IfM Bonn: 70,000 companies). Projected AI adoption rate 45% by 2027 (from 36% in 2025, Bitkom) = ~30,000 SAM. Average ACV entry €24K, expansion to €60K by Year 3. SAM value: ~€1.5B/year at average ACV.
- 🎯 SOM YEAR 3 (DEFENSIBLE): 50 customers × €60K average ACV = €3M ARR. Represents <0.2% of SAM. Conservative by design — requires winning less than 1 in 600 addressable companies. Expansion ARPU driver: customers start at 1–2 Ploxe (€24K), grow to 4–6 Ploxe by Year 3 (€60K+) — built-in net dollar retention.
- 🌍 GLOBAL CONTEXT: AI Platform Market $18.2B growing at 38.9% CAGR to $94B by 2030 (MarketsandMarkets). MLOps market $2.3B growing at 28.9% CAGR (Fortune Business Insights). Europe: 29–33% share. NeuraPlox is not competing in 'AI tools' — it is defining the Agent OS sub-category, adjacent to disrupting enterprise middleware (€80K–€150K/project IT consulting market) and RPA workflows.
- 📈 CATEGORY CREATION MULTIPLIER: SAP started in DACH, won globally. Salesforce started in CRM, became a platform. Agent OS follows the same pattern — DACH is the beachhead, European sovereignty is the moat, global expansion is the outcome. Category creators do not take share — they create the market.

**Key Metrics:**
- ICP count: 70,000 companies (IfM Bonn, 50–500 employees, DACH)
- SAM: ~30,000 companies × avg €50K ACV = ~€1.5B/year
- SOM Year 3: €3M ARR (50 customers) = <0.2% of SAM

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Lead with the bottom-up, not the top-down. The €1.5B SAM sounds credible because it is derived from a real ICP count from IfM Bonn, not from a market research report multiplied by a percentage. The SOM is intentionally conservative — less than 0.2% of the addressable market — because defensible numbers matter more than impressive ones. The ARPU expansion story is the NDR driver: customers start small and expand as they deploy more Ploxe. Acknowledge the category creation framing: we are not taking share from Palantir or Dataiku, we are creating a market that did not exist. Category creators win disproportionately — and Earlybird has backed this pattern before.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: explicit 'Agent OS' as new market category, not share-taking; Capital-efficient growth: bottom-up SOM methodology with <0.2% penetration required — defensible and credible; Global winner potential: SAP/DACH-to-global analogy is specifically relevant for a European VC; European digital sovereignty: DACH beachhead with sovereignty moat is a structural advantage vs. US competitors

*Transition: A €1.5B SAM is compelling, but what makes the business model exceptional is the gross margin trajectory from 30% to 80%+ as we move from consulting to platform to marketplace.*

---

## Slide 8: Consulting Funds Today, Platform Captures Tomorrow, Marketplace Multiplies
*Type: business-model*

**Three-horizon model: services gross margin (30%) → platform SaaS (70%) → marketplace ecosystem (80%+). Each horizon de-risks the next.**

- 💼 H1 — CONSULTING (NOW, ~30% GM): Real revenue today, bootstrapped to 15 employees. Every engagement funds platform R&D AND generates a future platform customer. Consulting is not a pivot risk — it is the zero-CAC customer acquisition channel for early platform deals.
- 🚀 H2 — PLATFORM SAAS (12–18 MONTHS, ~70% GM): Managed Service €2,000–8,000/month (€24K–96K ACV). Customer Cloud €1,500–5,000/month. Per-agent, per-connector pricing creates natural expansion revenue. Entry ACV €24K is 2× cheaper than Dataiku, 6× cheaper than Palantir — wins on price AND governance.
- 🏪 H3 — MARKETPLACE (24+ MONTHS, ~80%+ GM): Revenue share 15–25% on third-party Ploxe. SDK licensing for ISVs and system integrators. Certification fees for external agent validation. Scales without proportional headcount — the Shopify model for enterprise AI operations.
- 📊 UNIT ECONOMICS: Entry ACV €24K → expansion ACV €60K+ by Year 3 (~150% NDR proxy). Implementation <6 weeks (vs. 3–6 months competitors) drives payback period under 12 months. ZIM grant covers 45% of core R&D — capital-efficient by design. Burn multiple target: <1.5× once platform revenue begins.
- 🔄 SUBSTITUTION, NOT ADDITION: NeuraPlox replaces existing KI project costs (€80K–€150K per project, 60% infrastructure). ROI case at customer: single platform subscription (€24K/year) vs. recurring infrastructure rebuilds (€48K–€90K per project). Amortizes on Project 1.

**Key Metrics:**
- Entry ACV: €24,000/year | Expansion ACV: €60,000+ by Year 3
- Gross margin trajectory: 30% (consulting) → 70% (SaaS) → 80%+ (marketplace)
- Burn multiple target: <1.5× once platform revenue begins

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The three-horizon story is critical to combat the 'consulting company trying to productize' objection. Consulting is not the business — it is the R&D lab that paid for the product intuition and funds operations while the platform is built. The ZIM grant structure matters here: 45% of the R&D cost is government-funded, which means the capital efficiency of this raise is exceptional — €2M goes significantly further because €237K of the core R&D is already covered. The marketplace economics are the real prize: once third-party developers build Ploxe on the platform, each new agent makes the platform more valuable without proportional cost increases.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: ZIM grant covers 45% of R&D; consulting revenue offsets burn; burn multiple target <1.5×; Gross margin trajectory: explicitly shown 30%→70%→80%+ — Earlybird's required metric; Category creation: marketplace/ecosystem model creates platform dynamics vs. point solution economics; AI as infrastructure not veneer: substitution (not addition) ROI case validates infrastructure positioning

*Transition: The business model is compelling on paper — but the most important question is: do we have evidence that real enterprises actually want this? The answer is yes, and here is the proof.*

---

## Slide 9: 25+ Enterprise Projects, ZIM-Validated, Four Live Pilots with Real Data
*Type: traction*

**No platform ARR yet — and we are being direct about that. What we have is consulting-funded product-market fit, government-validated technology, and four named pilots proving the architecture works with real enterprise data.**

- 🏗️ PLATFORM VALIDATION (TRL 4 → TRL 7 IN PROGRESS): ZIM grant of €237,375 awarded (45% of €527,499 total project cost) — Germany's rigorous innovation program validates both technology and team. Four live pilot customers with LOIs signed, each validating different architecture layers with real enterprise data.
- 🔬 FOUR PILOT CASE STUDIES: (1) Services firm — agent orchestration and data integration validated in controlled environment. (2) Real estate investor — data integration and agent logic validated on real investment data. (3) Tax advisory — ML-based pattern recognition on real Jahresabschlussbuchungen, measurable accuracy improvement on booking compliance classification. (4) Startup — base architecture modules in test operation.
- 📈 EXPANSION PROXY (NDR SIGNAL): Customer behavior in consulting mode already shows expansion patterns: engagements grow from 1–2 use cases in Year 1 to 4–6 by Year 3 — equivalent to ~300% ARPU expansion. Repeat engagements across 4 sectors (services, real estate, tax advisory, tech) prove structural demand, not one-off.
- 💪 TEAM CAPITAL EFFICIENCY: 15-person team bootstrapped in 2 years with zero institutional capital. 25+ KI projects delivered across Mittelstand sectors — more real enterprise AI deployments than most agent startups see in 5 years. Consulting revenue covers operations; ZIM grant covers R&D.
- 🎯 THIS RAISE FUNDS THE TRANSITION: Platform ARR = 0 today, by design. Every consulting project confirms the infrastructure problem. This €2M seed accelerates the platform launch by 12+ months and funds the first 10 paying platform customers. That is the Series A proof point.

**Key Metrics:**
- 25+ enterprise KI projects delivered
- €237,375 ZIM grant secured (TRL 4→7 roadmap funded at 45%)
- 15-person team, bootstrapped, zero institutional capital to date

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Be direct about the stage: zero platform ARR. Do not hide it — frame it. The consulting revenue and ZIM grant are evidence of two things: (1) real enterprises pay real money to solve exactly the problem NeuraPlox platforms, and (2) Germany's most rigorous technology grant program has validated the architecture. The four pilot case studies are the most important traction signal — they are not mock demos, they are real enterprise data validating real architecture components. The tax advisory case is particularly strong: ML-based accuracy measurement on real bookkeeping data is a quantifiable outcome. The NDR proxy from consulting expansion behavior is a forward indicator of platform net dollar retention.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: bootstrapped to 15 people, ZIM grant as non-dilutive R&D co-funding — directly maps to Earlybird's capital efficiency requirement; Named customer evidence with quantified ROI: four anonymized pilot cases with specific outcome descriptions; Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: 25+ real deployments signals genuine vertical depth; AI as infrastructure not veneer: TRL framing (4→7) signals applied engineering, not research

*Transition: With validated demand and a clear platform architecture, here is exactly how we plan to reach 10 paying customers in Year 1 and 50 by Year 3.*

---

## Slide 10: Land via Consulting, Expand via Platform, Open via Marketplace
*Type: go-to-market*

**Three phases, zero wasted acquisition spend: consulting provides a warm pipeline at no CAC, partner channel scales without proportional headcount, marketplace creates compounding ecosystem economics.**

- 🎯 ICP: CTOs, IT directors, and technically literate CEOs at Mittelstand companies (50–500 employees, DACH). Trigger events: (1) First AI project cost overrun — 63% of KMU report this (maximal.digital 2025). (2) EU AI Act compliance due diligence begins. (3) Second or third AI agent project reveals N×M integration tax. Sectors: services, finance/tax advisory, real estate, manufacturing.
- 🌱 PHASE 1 — LAND (Year 1, target 10 paying customers): Convert 3 ZIM pilot customers to paid platform contracts. Direct sales via Solution Architect + Customer Success Manager. Consulting relationships provide warm pipeline at ~€0 CAC. Referral-driven growth from documented business cases (implementation time, cost savings, compliance proof).
- 📈 PHASE 2 — EXPAND (Year 2, target 30–50 customers): Self-serve platform onboarding for mid-market. Activate 5–10 IT consultancies and Systemhäuser as certified partners with Plox-SDK access. Land-and-expand: single Plox entry → 4–6 Ploxe by Year 3, leveraging existing N+M connectors. Each new customer's connectors benefit all agents on the platform.
- 🏪 PHASE 3 — OPEN (Year 3+, 50+ customers + ecosystem): Third-party Plox marketplace with revenue share (15–25%). ISO 27001/42001 certification as procurement differentiator. DACH expansion → Austria and Switzerland via local partners. Platform flywheel: more agents → more connectors → better governance data → more trust → more agents.
- 🏆 TRUST MOAT: 93% of German companies prefer German AI providers (Bitkom 2025). ISO certifications + EU AI Act compliance by design + ZIM validation create a sovereign credibility stack that US hyperscalers cannot replicate. Sales cycle estimated 60–90 days for managed service entry, 90–150 days for customer cloud deployment.

**Key Metrics:**
- Year 1 target: 10 paying platform customers, ~€600K ARR
- Year 2 target: 30–50 customers, ~€2.4M ARR
- Sales cycle estimate: 60–90 days (managed service entry)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The GTM model is deliberately capital-efficient. Consulting provides zero-cost lead generation for the first wave of platform customers — these are not cold outbound targets, they are enterprises that have already paid us to understand their infrastructure problems. The partner channel (IT consultancies, Systemhäuser) is the scaling mechanism: they bring the customer relationships, we bring the platform. ISO certification is not just a compliance checkbox — in the German Mittelstand, it is a hard procurement requirement in regulated verticals. The land-and-expand motion is architectural: because existing connectors and governance configurations reuse across use cases (N+M, not N×M), every new Plox a customer deploys has near-zero marginal integration cost.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: ~€0 CAC for early customers via consulting pipeline; partner channel scales without headcount; European digital sovereignty: 93% German provider preference creates structural sales advantage; Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: sector-specific triggers (EU AI Act, N×M tax) show vertical ICP precision; Global winner potential: DACH land-and-expand → DACH partner ecosystem → international expansion is a proven European playbook

*Transition: The GTM advantage is reinforced by a competitive landscape where every existing solution either cannot govern agents, cannot afford Mittelstand pricing, or cannot provide the infrastructure depth enterprises actually need.*

---

## Slide 11: We Are Not Competing — We Are Defining a New Category
*Type: competitive-landscape*

**On two axes that matter — infrastructure depth and Mittelstand economics — NeuraPlox stands alone. Every other player optimizes for one axis and fails on the other.**

- 📊 POSITIONING MATRIX (Infrastructure Depth × Mittelstand Economics): TOP RIGHT = NeuraPlox (deep architecture, Mittelstand-priced). TOP LEFT = Palantir/Dataiku (deep architecture, €48K–€150K+ — enterprise only). BOTTOM RIGHT = Langdock/Copilot (Mittelstand-priced, application layer only — no infrastructure). BOTTOM LEFT = LangChain/CrewAI (developer libraries, no infrastructure, no governance, no deployment).
- 🔍 KEY DIFFERENTIATORS VS. EACH CATEGORY: Hyperscalers (Azure, AWS, GCP): vendor lock-in by design, no agent governance, no Mittelstand abstraction. Enterprise platforms (Palantir, Dataiku): €48K–€150K+ entry price, classic ML focus, zero agent-centric governance. Agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI): developer libraries only — no deployment, no governance, no production path. Adoption platforms (Langdock, Copilot): application layer only — NeuraPlox is the infrastructure that Langdock would run ON.
- 🛡️ COMPETITIVE MOAT (FOUR LAYERS): (1) Architectural: 3D-Policy Model is proprietary — no existing platform treats agents as identity-governed entities. (2) Network: N+M connector network — more agents make connectors more valuable; more connectors make agents more capable. (3) Regulatory: EU AI Act compliance by design creates switching costs once deployed. (4) Sovereign: German company, German grant, EU data residency — 93% of German enterprises prefer this.
- ⚡ AI COMMODITIZATION RESPONSE: As LLM models commoditize (GPT-4 class capabilities now available open-source), the governance + integration layer becomes MORE valuable, not less. NeuraPlox is model-agnostic by design — we route to the best model for each task. Our moat is proprietary infrastructure, not proprietary models. This is exactly the right architectural bet.

**Key Metrics:**
- NeuraPlox entry: €24K/year vs. Palantir €150K+/year (6–10× cheaper)
- vs. Dataiku: 2× cheaper at entry, with agent governance Dataiku cannot provide
- vs. LangChain: production-ready in <6 weeks vs. 3–6 months of custom infrastructure build

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The most important point on this slide is the category creator framing: we are not taking 10% of Palantir's market or 10% of LangChain's user base. We are creating a new market category — the Agent OS — that sits between the application layer (Langdock, Copilot) and the infrastructure layer (Kubernetes, cloud). This positioning is exactly how SAP positioned itself not as better accounting software, but as a new category of enterprise resource planning. The AI commoditization rebuttal is essential for sophisticated investors: our moat is not in the models, it is in the proprietary infrastructure that makes any model safe for enterprise deployment.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: explicit positioning as category creator, not competitor — mirrors Earlybird's UiPath/remberg pattern; AI as infrastructure not veneer: commoditization rebuttal directly addresses Earlybird's AI infrastructure thesis; European digital sovereignty: sovereign moat layer (German company, EU data, ZIM validation) is structural; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: four-layer moat demonstrates defensibility beyond first-mover advantage

*Transition: Category creation requires a team that has been deep inside the problem long enough to build what enterprises actually need — not what looks good in a demo.*

## Slide 12: 15 People, 25+ Deployments, Deep Enterprise AI Domain Expertise
*Type: team*

**Two founders who have run AI transformation at the enterprise level, supported by a senior engineering team with 5+ years each in KI/ML, cloud infrastructure, and security.**

- 👤 CHRISTOPH KNÖLL (CEO): Ex-PwC Senior Manager Transactions — led M&A, IT, and KI strategy projects in the double-digit millions EUR range (Carve-Outs, Due Diligences, Post-Merger Integrations). TÜV SÜD Innovator. Deep expertise in distributed KI systems, EU AI Act compliance (certified instructor), and enterprise transformation. Background gives him the enterprise buyer credibility and the technical depth to build what enterprises actually need.
- 👤 SYLVIA KNÖLL (COO): Transformation expertise from Allianz and Oliver Wyman. Led complex organizational change programs across financial services. Brings the operational discipline and change management expertise that enterprise AI deployments require — the '50% Mensch' of operational AI.
- 🏗️ SENIOR ENGINEERING TEAM (13 additional): Senior Software Architect (platform lead, 10.5PM ZIM), ML/AI Engineer (RAG + PII detection), DevOps/Platform Engineer (Kubernetes + GitOps), Senior NLP/ML Specialist (German NER + RAG optimization), Senior Kubernetes/Security Engineer (K8s hardening + penetration testing). All with 5+ years in KI/ML engineering, software architecture, or cloud infrastructure.
- 🔬 UNFAIR ADVANTAGE — 25+ REAL DEPLOYMENTS: This team has seen more enterprise AI failures than most agent startups see in 5 years. KI-assisted Due Diligence systems, automated order processing, care worker placement automation, warehouse logistics AI — across sectors and data environments. This consulting experience IS the product intuition. NeuraPlox was not designed in a vacuum; it was reverse-engineered from what enterprises actually need in production.
- ⚠️ CTO GAP — ADDRESSED HEAD-ON: Hiring a platform-scale CTO is use-of-funds priority #1. Target profile: deep Kubernetes and distributed systems, platform product thinking, ideally experience scaling a B2B SaaS infrastructure product. We know exactly who we need — this raise funds the hire. This is self-awareness, not weakness.

**Key Metrics:**
- 15-person team, bootstrapped in 2 years
- 25+ enterprise KI projects: Due Diligence AI, order automation, care worker placement, warehouse logistics
- Combined enterprise transformation experience: PwC, Allianz, Oliver Wyman

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The most important thing to convey about this team is not the CVs — it is the consulting experience as unfair advantage. Other agent startups are building products they think enterprises need. We built consulting products for 25 real enterprises, saw exactly what failed (N×M integrations, governance gaps, PoC graveyards), and then built the platform to solve it. That is a fundamentally different product-market fit signal. The CTO gap must be addressed proactively — name it, frame it correctly as 'we know what we need and we're raising to hire it,' and move on. Investors respect self-awareness far more than they respect founders who pretend the gap doesn't exist.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: PwC M&A/IT strategy + Allianz/Oliver Wyman transformation = exactly Earlybird's founder profile preference; Capital-efficient growth: bootstrapped to 15 people signals resourcefulness and product discipline; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: 25+ real deployments is the commercialization track record; European digital sovereignty: German founders, German enterprise experience, German regulatory expertise (EU AI Act certified)

*Transition: Here is what this team delivers financially: a revenue trajectory that shows the consulting-to-platform transition, the path to break-even, and why the burn profile is exceptionally capital-efficient.*

## Slide 13: Consulting Offsets Burn, ZIM Covers R&D, Platform Converts in 12 Months
*Type: financials*

**Current burn is offset by consulting revenue and ZIM grant funding. Platform launch in 12 months targets €600K ARR with 10 customers. Break-even at ~40–50 platform customers — achievable by Year 2–3.**

- 📊 REVENUE TRAJECTORY: Year 0 (now): Consulting revenue [undisclosed, covers operations] + ZIM grant €237,375 for R&D. Year 1 (post-platform launch): €600K ARR target (10 platform customers × €60K avg ACV). Year 2: €2.4M ARR (40 customers). Year 3: €3.0M ARR (50 customers) + ecosystem revenue (SDK, revenue share, certification).
- 💰 COST STRUCTURE: ZIM grant covers 45% of core R&D (€237,375 of €527,499 total project cost). Consulting revenue offsets team operating costs. €2M seed raise funds: CTO + 2–3 senior engineers (~50%), platform GA launch (~30%), SDK/marketplace beta (~20%). No burn without counter-financing from day one.
- 📉 BURN PROFILE: Consulting revenue provides ongoing operating offset — team is not burning on a pure VC runway clock. ZIM grant is milestone-gated (MS1 June 2026 through MS5 April 2027) providing non-dilutive validation. Target burn multiple: <1.5× once platform revenue commences. Capital efficiency ratio target: revenue-to-raised approaching 1:1 by Year 2.
- 🏁 PATH TO BREAK-EVEN: Approximately 40–50 platform customers at €60K average ACV = €2.4–3M ARR covers fully loaded team of 20–25. Achievable in Year 2–3 on current GTM trajectory. Marketplace revenue from Year 3 creates additional margin leverage without proportional cost increase.

**Key Metrics:**
- Year 1 target: €600K ARR (10 customers × €60K ACV)
- Break-even: ~40–50 platform customers (~€2.4–3M ARR)
- ZIM grant: €237,375 non-dilutive R&D co-funding (45% of project cost)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The financial story is about capital efficiency, not scale. Earlybird's thesis explicitly prioritizes burn multiple below 1.5× and revenue-to-raised near 1:1 — NeuraPlox is structured to hit both. The key insight is the three-layer burn offset: consulting revenue covers operations, ZIM grant covers R&D, and the seed raise accelerates the platform transition. Without the raise, we get to platform eventually — but we lose the category-creation window. With it, we hit 10 paying customers and marketplace beta within 18 months, which is the Series A proof point. Be honest that exact consulting revenue figures are not disclosed in this deck — a data room request is the right next step.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: explicitly targets <1.5× burn multiple and revenue-to-raised near 1:1 — Earlybird's stated requirements; Burn multiple: ZIM grant + consulting revenue creates structural capital efficiency unavailable to competitors; Category creation: revenue trajectory maps to category-creation timing — platform launch in 12 months must precede the EU AI Act deadline; European digital sovereignty: ZIM grant as non-dilutive government validation reinforces European sovereign infrastructure positioning

*Transition: With the financials clear, here is exactly what the €2M raise funds, the milestones it delivers, and why the window for this raise is now.*

## Slide 14: €2,000,000 Seed Round — One Number, Defended
*Type: the-ask*

**€2M funds the platform launch, the CTO hire, and the first 10 paying customers — the proof points required for a Series A in 18 months.**

- 💶 THE ASK: €2,000,000 Seed. Not a range. ZIM grant (€237,375) is already secured and covers 45% of core R&D — this raise goes further than its face value. Consulting revenue offsets operations. Total effective runway: 24+ months.
- 🔨 USE OF FUNDS: (1) CTO + 2–3 senior platform engineers — 50% (~€1M). Platform-scale Kubernetes/distributed systems expertise, platform product thinking. This is the single highest-leverage hire. (2) Platform GA launch — 30% (~€600K). Complete TRL 4→7 development, go-to-market readiness, first 10 customer onboardings. (3) SDK + Marketplace beta — 20% (~€400K). Plox-SDK documentation, partner onboarding, 3-tier certification framework, first third-party agent.
- 🏁 18-MONTH MILESTONES THIS RAISE DELIVERS: Platform GA with 3 ZIM pilot customers live (April 2027, MS5). First 10 paying platform customers (Year 1 post-launch). Marketplace beta with Plox-SDK and first third-party Plox. ISO 27001/42001 readiness assessments completed. €600K ARR → Series A proof point.
- ⏰ WHY NOW: Without this raise, platform launch happens — just 12+ months slower, risking the category-creation window. The EU AI Act August 2026 deadline creates urgency on the customer side. LLM cost curves make agents viable now. Our 25 consulting projects have built the pipeline and product intuition. The window is open. This raise closes it.
- 🔮 SERIES A BRIDGE: €600K ARR + 10 named platform customers + marketplace beta + ISO certifications = Series A-ready metrics for a €10–15M raise at €3–5M ARR. DACH-to-European expansion is the Series A growth story. Platform is the proof point; marketplace is the multiplier.

**Key Metrics:**
- Raise: €2,000,000 (one number)
- 18-month target: €600K ARR, 10 paying platform customers
- Series A bridge: €3–5M ARR target, €10–15M raise

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

One number — €2M — and defend it precisely. The ZIM grant structure is the killer argument for capital efficiency: 45% of the core R&D is already funded by the German government, so this raise goes significantly further than its face value. The CTO hire as 50% of use-of-funds is a signal of operational self-awareness — founders who know exactly what they need to hire next are significantly less risky than those who spread hiring across undefined roles. The Series A bridge is explicit: €600K ARR with 10 named customers and marketplace beta are the metrics that get a European enterprise infrastructure company to Series A. Close with the urgency argument: without this raise, the category-creation window starts to close.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: ZIM grant leverage means €2M provides >€2M effective capital; consulting offset means no pure burn clock; Clear commercialization path: 18-month milestones explicitly bridge to Series A metrics; Category creation: 'category-creation window' framing creates urgency without hype; European digital sovereignty: ISO certifications and EU AI Act compliance position NeuraPlox as the sovereign infrastructure partner

*Transition: Before we close, one final slide on the technical architecture — because for AI-specific investors, the depth of the technology moat is the ultimate defensibility test.*

## Slide 15: The Open AI OS for Europe — Built Here, Governed Here, Sovereign Here
*Type: ai-architecture*

**Every enterprise will run AI agents. The question is not IF — it is ON WHAT. We are building the operating system they will run on. Open. Governed. European.**

- 🏛️ THE CATEGORY MOMENT: SAP defined enterprise operations. Salesforce defined CRM. Shopify defined e-commerce infrastructure. NeuraPlox defines the Agent OS — the layer between raw AI models and enterprise workflows where governance, integration, and orchestration live. Category creators from Europe win globally. We intend to.
- 🌍 EUROPEAN DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY BY ARCHITECTURE: Data stays in European hands — cloud-agnostic (Azure, AWS, GCP, on-premise), DSGVO-compliant PII detection by design, EU AI Act governance as a product feature not a consulting engagement. Open architecture prevents vendor lock-in by construction — open standards (Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, Helm) at the infrastructure layer, proprietary governance at the value layer.
- 🔒 THE MOAT IS THE OS: As AI models commoditize and become interchangeable, the infrastructure that makes any model enterprise-safe becomes the durable asset. NeuraPlox's proprietary value — the 3D-Policy governance model, the N+M connector network, the agent identity registry — is architecture-level IP, not model-level IP. This is the correct long-term bet.
- 🚀 THE PATH IS PROVEN: SAP started in Walldorf serving German manufacturers. remberg started in Munich serving industrial maintenance. HiveMQ started in Landshut serving IoT infrastructure. European deep tech companies built on domain expertise in home markets win globally with the right infrastructure thesis. NeuraPlox is the infrastructure thesis for the agent era.
- 📞 THE OPPORTUNITY: €2M Seed. €237,375 ZIM co-funding already secured. 25+ enterprise deployments. 15-person team. EU AI Act tailwind. 93% German provider preference. Category creation window open for 12–18 months. Christoph Knöll | kontakt@neurawork.de | www.neurawork.de

**Key Metrics:**
- Global AI Platform Market: $18.2B → $94B by 2030 (38.9% CAGR)
- 93% of German companies prefer German AI providers (Bitkom 2025)
- BMWK investing €5B+ in AI and digital sovereignty infrastructure

<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

End with vision and emotion, not technology. The investor should leave this room thinking about category creation and European sovereignty — not architecture layers. The SAP, Salesforce, Shopify analogies are not hubris — they are the category-creation pattern that Earlybird has backed repeatedly. The Earlybird portfolio framing (remberg, HiveMQ, Aleph Alpha) is intentional: NeuraPlox fits the thesis. The closing visual should be clean: the bold statement — 'Open. Governed. European.' — and the contact. Do not put another architecture diagram on the last slide. End with the call to action and the belief that Europe can and should own this infrastructure layer.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: European digital sovereignty: this slide IS the sovereignty thesis — built here, governed here, data stays here; Category creation: explicit category creation moment framing — the Agent OS as the next major enterprise software category; Global winner potential: DACH-to-global path explicitly referenced with European deep tech precedents; Capital-efficient growth: ZIM grant + consulting revenue + precise use-of-funds = Earlybird's capital efficiency thesis embodied

*Transition: This is the end of the formal presentation. We welcome your questions — and we have a data room ready with full ZIM documentation, pilot customer details, and technical architecture specifications.*
