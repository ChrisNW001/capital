#  — Pitch Deck
**Target**: Earlybird Capital
**Generated**: 2026-02-26T23:41:41.381549

## Narrative Arc
A demand-born product story: Neurawork spent two years inside 25+ enterprise AI deployments and discovered the same failure point every time — infrastructure, not ambition. NeuraPlox is the platform that emerged from that pattern. The pitch moves from systemic pain (AI fails at infrastructure) through urgency (EU AI Act August 2026, agent explosion) to a globally-positioned solution (the Agent OS for decision-capable companies worldwide), validated by EUR 2M bootstrapped revenue, named customers, and a capital-efficient team. The close asks Earlybird to fund the platform build — not survival, but acceleration.

---

## Slide 1: NeuraPlox — The Agent OS for Enterprise AI
*Type: cover*

**The operating system for AI agents — born from 25+ enterprise deployments, not a whiteboard.**

**Key Metrics:**
- >EUR 2M revenue, bootstrapped
- Raising EUR 3M Seed

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Open with one sentence: 'We didn't start with a technology idea — we started inside enterprises, building AI systems, and kept hitting the same wall.' Let the revenue figure and bootstrapped status land before you say anything else. This signals capital efficiency immediately.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth signal: EUR 2M revenue bootstrapped with 4-5 engineers; Demand-first origin story aligns with Earlybird's preference for founders with deep domain expertise; Product name and one-liner position NeuraPlox as category-defining infrastructure — echoes UiPath/RPA framing

*Transition: Let me show you exactly what we've learned from the inside — and why the timing has never been more critical.*

---

## Slide 2: Executive Summary: The Agent OS Is Missing
*Type: executive-summary*

**NeuraPlox is the infrastructure layer that makes AI agents safe, operational, and scalable — for any company that moves fast.**

- 25+ enterprise AI deployments revealed one consistent failure: infrastructure, not ambition — 60% of every project budget consumed by rebuild-from-scratch plumbing
- NeuraPlox: a 7-layer Agent OS that reduces infrastructure cost to <30% and deployment time from 3-6 months to <6 weeks
- EUR 2M+ revenue bootstrapped in year two from consulting — zero external capital, zero cold acquisition
- Raising EUR 3M Seed to complete the platform and activate the global Agent Marketplace

**Key Metrics:**
- EUR 2M+ revenue, year two, bootstrapped
- 25+ enterprise deployments
- EUR 3M Seed raise

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

This is your 30-second thesis statement. Hit the four points in sequence: we have real demand evidence, we have a clear product, we have revenue proof, and we know exactly what the Seed buys. Don't elaborate yet — let each point create a question the next slide will answer.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital efficiency is the headline signal — EUR 2M revenue with 4-5 engineers and zero raised; AI as infrastructure framing directly matches Earlybird thesis point 4; Category creation narrative: 'Agent OS' is a new category, not an incremental product; Demand-validated origin matches Earlybird preference for domain-expert founders

*Transition: To understand why this matters, you need to see what we saw inside those 25 deployments.*

---

## Slide 3: AI Adoption Is Stalling at Infrastructure
*Type: problem*

**86% of mid-market companies know AI is strategic. Only 23% have successfully operationalized it. The gap is infrastructure — not ambition.**

- 60% of every AI project budget is consumed by redundant infrastructure: data connectors, API management, authentication — rebuilt from zero each time (Neurawork, 25+ deployments)
- N×M integration explosion: 10 agents × 10 data sources = 100 individual integrations to build, test, and maintain — combinatorial complexity that kills projects
- 73% of enterprises report inadequate control over AI agent behavior; 47% already run generative AI without any governance framework (Langflow/DataStax 2025, IW Köln 2025)
- 63% of companies report AI project cost overruns averaging 34% over budget — caused by the absence of reusable base infrastructure (maximal.digital KMU Study 2025)

**Key Metrics:**
- 86% recognize AI as strategic; 23% operationalized (maximal.digital 2025)
- 60% infrastructure overhead per project (Neurawork field data)
- 34% average cost overrun (maximal.digital 2025)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The key insight to land here is that this is a structural problem, not a knowledge problem. Companies want AI — they have use cases, they have budget intent. They fail at plumbing. Use the N×M metaphor: '3 agents, 5 data sources — that's already 15 integrations. At 10 and 10, it's 100. And every single one is built from scratch, every single time.' That's the wall we kept hitting.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Market evidence from cited sources satisfies Earlybird's data-driven narrative preference; Field data from 25+ deployments positions founders as domain experts — key Earlybird criterion; Infrastructure framing aligns with thesis: 'AI as infrastructure, not veneer'

*Transition: This problem exists everywhere — but right now, three forces are converging to make it impossible to ignore.*

---

## Slide 4: Three Forces Converging — The Window Is Now
*Type: why-now*

**Agent adoption is exploding, regulation is enforcing compliance deadlines, and the infrastructure layer has never been built. This is a 12-month window.**

- Agent explosion: Gartner projects 40%+ of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by 2026 — every deployment needs the infrastructure layer NeuraPlox provides
- Regulatory hard deadline: EU AI Act high-risk provisions take effect August 2026 — companies without audit trails, access controls, and governance will face enforcement exposure
- Infrastructure gap crystallizing: LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen prove agent demand but ship zero production infrastructure — every team using these frameworks must build NeuraPlox themselves
- European sovereignty imperative: 93% of German companies prefer EU-based AI providers (Bitkom 2025); BMWK investing EUR 5B+ in AI sovereignty — structural tailwind for European infrastructure

**Key Metrics:**
- August 2026: EU AI Act enforcement deadline
- 40%+ enterprise apps with embedded agents by 2026 (Gartner)
- EUR 5B+ BMWK AI sovereignty investment

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Frame this as a convergence, not a single driver. 'If it were just regulation, we'd be a compliance tool. If it were just agent adoption, we'd be a framework. The combination of all three — exploding demand, enforcement deadlines, and zero production infrastructure — is what creates a platform opportunity that didn't exist 18 months ago.' The August 2026 deadline is your urgency anchor.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: European digital sovereignty angle explicitly addressed — critical Earlybird requirement; Regulatory driver (EU AI Act) framed as accelerator, not threat — shows market sophistication; Agent infrastructure gap maps to Earlybird portfolio pattern: infrastructure before application layer; BMWK investment signals government-level validation of the problem space

*Transition: Here's exactly what we built to capture this moment — and why it can't be replicated quickly.*

---

## Slide 5: NeuraPlox: The Agent OS — What SAP Did for Business Processes, We Will Do for AI Agents
*Type: solution*

**A 7-layer platform that gives any company production-ready AI agent infrastructure in under 6 weeks — not 6 months.**

- For CTOs and IT leaders at companies with 50-500 employees who keep hitting the infrastructure wall on AI projects
- NeuraPlox provides a complete, reusable Agent OS: deploy once, run unlimited agents — no rebuild, no vendor lock-in, no black box
- Security-first design: every agent has its own identity, permission matrix, and audit trail — your AI cannot compromise your business operations
- Quantified impact: infrastructure cost drops from 60% to <30% of project budget; deployment accelerates 4-5x (validated in active pilot environments)
- Operational AI model: 50% technology, 50% human — Neurawork operates your agents continuously, not just deploys them

**Key Metrics:**
- Infrastructure cost: 60% → <30% (measured)
- Deployment time: 3-6 months → <6 weeks (4-5x acceleration)
- EUR 45-75K average savings per project

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Lead with the security framing, not governance. 'Think of it like this: you don't buy a firewall because of GDPR. You buy it because you don't want your business hacked. NeuraPlox is the firewall for AI agents — the compliance follows from the architecture.' Then hit the SAP analogy: 'SAP standardized business process infrastructure. Nobody builds their own ERP anymore. Nobody should build their own AI agent infrastructure either.' These two analogies do more work than any technical description.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: SAP analogy directly invokes category creation — a core Earlybird investment thesis; Security-first framing (not compliance-first) positions this as universal value prop, not EU-specific; Quantified ROI from real deployments satisfies Earlybird's requirement for customer evidence with ROI; Operational AI model previews the Operations as a Service revenue layer — Merchant Solutions analogy

*Transition: Let me show you exactly what that infrastructure looks like under the hood.*

---

## Slide 6: 7-Layer Architecture: Every Layer Is a Moat
*Type: product*

**NeuraPlox stacks security, governance, and intelligence into a single deployable Agent OS — proprietary layers L4-L7 are the defensible core.**

- Execution Layer (L1-L3, open-source): Kubernetes-native deployment, MLOps with MLflow/Feast, LLM Gateway with provider routing + RAG hybrid search — builds developer community, drives platform adoption
- Control Plane (L4-L7, proprietary): Multi-Agent Observability, Unified Data Access with N+M connector architecture, Policy & Governance Engine, Agent Registry — this is the IP that cannot be replicated with open-source tooling
- 3D Policy Model (Who × What × Which Data): agents treated as first-class security identities with individual permission matrices — no existing platform implements this at the agent level
- Plox Ecosystem: third-party agents deploy onto the platform via SDK, creating a marketplace with certification tiers and revenue-share — the Salesforce AppExchange for AI agents
- Cloud-agnostic, model-agnostic: runs on Azure, AWS, GCP, or on-premise; switches LLM providers without architecture changes — zero vendor lock-in by design

**Key Metrics:**
- 7 architecture layers
- N+M vs N×M integration complexity reduction
- 3-tier agent certification framework

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Walk through the open/proprietary split deliberately: 'L1-L3 we plan to open-source — that builds our developer community and pulls enterprises to the platform. L4-L7 is proprietary. That's the Policy Engine, the Agent Registry, the Observability layer — the parts that make AI safe in production. Nobody builds that themselves. That's where we monetize.' The 3D Policy Model deserves a sentence: 'No firewall vendor manages agents as security identities. No agent framework has per-agent permission matrices. This is genuinely new.'

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Open-source L1-L3 strategy mirrors Earlybird portfolio company HiveMQ's community-first approach; Proprietary Control Plane (L4-L7) creates the data and workflow moat Earlybird requires; Agent marketplace previews platform economics — category-defining, not feature-adding; Cloud-agnostic design directly addresses European sovereignty requirements

*Transition: Now let's look at the size of the market this infrastructure addresses — and why we're sizing it globally.*

---

## Slide 7: EUR 94B Market — DACH Is the Beachhead, Not the Ceiling
*Type: market-sizing*

**Bottom-up: 30,000 addressable companies in DACH alone at EUR 50K ACV = EUR 1.5B. EU-27 adds EUR 10B+. Global AI platform TAM reaches EUR 94B by 2030.**

- DACH SAM (bottom-up): 70,000 companies with 50-500 employees × ~45% projected AI adoption rate by 2027 = 30,000 addressable accounts × EUR 50K average ACV = EUR 1.5B/year
- EU-27 expansion (zero localization): same platform, same compliance layer, 27 member states — EU AI Act creates uniform demand signal across all markets — EUR 10B+ SAM
- Global TAM: AI Platform Market at EUR 18B today, growing to EUR 94B by 2030 at 38.9% CAGR (MarketsandMarkets) — NeuraPlox targets the infrastructure layer of this market
- SOM Year 3: 50 customers × EUR 60K ACV = EUR 3M ARR (direct) + marketplace revenue — conservative, bottom-up, achievable from existing pipeline

**Key Metrics:**
- DACH SAM: EUR 1.5B
- EU-27 SAM: EUR 10B+
- Global TAM: EUR 94B by 2030 (38.9% CAGR)
- SOM Year 3: EUR 3M ARR

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Start bottom-up — never lead with the EUR 94B number or sophisticated investors will discount everything. 'Here's how we count: 70,000 companies in our size range in DACH. At current AI adoption trajectories, roughly 30,000 of those will need what we build. At EUR 50K ACV — which is conservative, we price from EUR 24K — that's EUR 1.5B in DACH alone. Then note: the same platform, zero changes, covers all 27 EU member states. EU AI Act means the compliance signal is identical across borders.' The global TAM is credibility context, not the pitch.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Bottom-up methodology explicitly required by Earlybird — delivered with ICP count and ARPU; Global expansion pathway addresses 'global winner from European base' thesis requirement; Market sizing shows beachhead → adjacent → global progression Earlybird wants to see; Conservative SOM signals financial discipline, not overclaiming

*Transition: Here's the business model that captures this market — and why the unit economics improve dramatically as we scale.*

---

## Slide 8: Three Horizons: Consulting → SaaS → Marketplace
*Type: business-model*

**Consulting validates demand today; SaaS platform scales to 70% margins; Marketplace reaches 80%+ with platform economics — same flywheel as Shopify.**

- Horizon 1 — Consulting/Services (now): EUR 2M+ revenue, ~30% gross margin — demand validation engine and zero-CAC customer acquisition channel
- Horizon 2 — SaaS Platform (Seed target): Managed Service EUR 24-96K/year ACV; Customer Cloud EUR 18-60K/year — 70% gross margin target at scale
- Horizon 3 — Marketplace + Operations as a Service: 15-25% revenue share on third-party agent transactions + continuous agent operations — 80%+ gross margin, Shopify Merchant Solutions model
- Land-and-expand built in: customers start with 1-2 agents; reusable integrations make adding agents near-zero marginal cost — target 4-6 agents per customer by year 3
- ZIM grant: EUR 237K (45% of EUR 527K R&D cost) non-dilutive co-funding from German government — validates technology innovation, reduces platform build cost

**Key Metrics:**
- ACV: EUR 24K-96K (Managed Service)
- Gross margin target: 70% (SaaS), 80%+ (Marketplace)
- ZIM grant: EUR 237K non-dilutive

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Use the Shopify analogy explicitly: 'Shopify generates roughly 75% of revenue from Merchant Solutions — payments, fulfillment, operations — not software subscriptions. Q3 2025: $2.1B Merchant Solutions vs $699M subscriptions. We are building the same model. NeuraPlox is the platform; Operations as a Service is our Merchant Solutions. The consulting business today is not a liability — it's our customer acquisition channel with zero CAC.' The ZIM grant signals government validation without requiring explanation.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Gross margin trajectory shown across all three horizons — Earlybird explicit requirement; Burn multiple context: EUR 2M revenue with minimal capital = exemplary capital efficiency; Three-horizon model demonstrates category creation thinking, not feature roadmap; Non-dilutive government funding reduces effective Seed dilution — capital efficiency signal

*Transition: Here's what the traction looks like — and why the pipeline is stronger than the revenue number alone suggests.*

---

## Slide 9: EUR 2M Bootstrapped — From Zero Cold Acquisition
*Type: traction*

**Every euro of revenue came from enterprises that came back. 100% of pipeline is from existing relationships. Zero cold acquisition cost.**

- EUR 2M+ revenue in year two, bootstrapped — entirely from consulting/services validating real enterprise willingness to pay for AI infrastructure expertise
- Named customer logos: Eventos, Falkensteg, Kalkül, Primus, Valor — active client base, multiple engagements, zero churn
- 25+ enterprise AI deployments completed: measured infrastructure overhead consistently at ~60% of project budget pre-NeuraPlox; architecture components reduce this to <30% in 4 active pilot environments
- Deployment time evidence: baseline 3-6 months for custom infrastructure; NeuraPlox target <6 weeks — 4-5x acceleration validated in live pilots (not projections)
- Architecture foundation built and component-validated across 4 live customer environments; ZIM grant (EUR 237K) awarded — independent technical validation from German government R&D program

**Key Metrics:**
- EUR 2M+ year-two revenue, bootstrapped
- 5 named customers, 25+ deployments
- 60% → <30% infrastructure cost (measured)
- EUR 237K ZIM grant awarded

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The zero cold acquisition point is the most important signal here for a VC. 'We have never made a cold outbound call. Every customer is a repeat engagement or a referral from an existing one. That is the strongest possible NDR proxy at pre-product stage — it tells you the retention dynamic before the platform even exists.' Then anchor on the measurement point: 'The 60% to 30% infrastructure reduction is not a projection. It is a measurement from real projects with real customer data. These are not claims — they are observations.'

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Named customer logos satisfy Earlybird's requirement for customer evidence with ROI; Zero CAC signal addresses burn multiple concern proactively; Measured (not projected) metrics satisfy data-driven narrative requirement; ZIM grant as independent validation — third-party credibility signal for technical claims

*Transition: Now let me show you how we turn this consulting pipeline into a scalable, global platform business.*

---

## Slide 10: DACH Beachhead → EU-27 → Global via Marketplace
*Type: go-to-market*

**Consulting pipeline converts to platform customers with zero CAC; partner channel scales to EU; Marketplace creates global supply-side pull without a global sales team.**

- ICP: CTOs and IT leaders at 50-500 employee companies — fast decision cycles, real budget, concrete AI use cases already identified — exists in DACH, US, UK, Nordics, APAC
- Phase 1 (DACH, Year 1-2): Convert 3 pilot customers to paid platform; direct sales from consulting relationships; target EUR 600K ARR (10 customers × EUR 60K ACV)
- Phase 2 (EU-27, Year 2-3): Channel partners in Netherlands, France, Nordics — zero product localization; EU AI Act creates uniform demand signal across all 27 member states
- Phase 3 (Global, Year 3+): Open-source L1-L3 layers create global developer community; Marketplace agents pull local enterprise customers onto platform — supply-side global distribution without a global sales force
- Land-and-expand flywheel: one agent deployment reuses all existing integrations for the next — marginal cost of each additional Plox approaches zero; average agent count grows from 1-2 to 4-6 per customer by year 3

**Key Metrics:**
- Target ARR Year 1: EUR 600K (10 customers)
- Target ARR Year 3: EUR 3M+ (50 customers + marketplace)
- Zero cold acquisition to date

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The global positioning is critical for Earlybird. 'We are not a Mittelstand tool. We are building for any company that moves fast, has budget, and can make a decision. Those companies exist in Frankfurt and in San Francisco. DACH is our beachhead because that's where our proof is — not because that's our ceiling.' Then explain the open-source scaling mechanism: 'We open-source the bottom three layers. That builds a global developer community. Every developer who builds an agent on NeuraPlox brings their enterprise customer to our platform. We don't need a sales team in Singapore — we need developers building agents there.'

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Global winner pathway explicitly addresses Earlybird's 'can this company lead globally?' requirement; Open-source community strategy mirrors HiveMQ (Earlybird portfolio) growth model; EU AI Act as uniform demand accelerator addresses European market timing for EU-27 phase; Partner channel activation reduces CAC at scale — capital efficiency maintained through growth

*Transition: Here's why no existing player — European or global — can replicate this position.*

---

## Slide 11: No One Occupies This Position
*Type: competitive-landscape*

**The market is split between expensive enterprise platforms (Palantir, Dataiku) and developer libraries (LangChain, CrewAI). NeuraPlox is the only production-ready Agent OS for decision-capable companies.**

- Positioning matrix: X-axis = Enterprise readiness (developer library → production platform); Y-axis = Accessibility (enterprise-only → mid-market fit) — NeuraPlox is the only occupant of the top-right quadrant
- Hyperscalers (Azure AI, AWS SageMaker): full lock-in, no agent governance, requires deep cloud engineering — 53% of target companies lack this expertise (Bitkom 2025)
- Enterprise platforms (Palantir EUR 150K+/year, Dataiku EUR 48K+/year): priced and sized for Fortune 500 with dedicated implementation teams — economically inaccessible to our ICP
- Agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen): solve agent logic only — no deployment infrastructure, no governance, no multi-tenancy; every team builds NeuraPlox themselves just to get to production

**Key Metrics:**
- Palantir: EUR 150K+/year vs NeuraPlox EUR 24K+/year (6x+ cheaper)
- Dataiku: EUR 48K+/year vs NeuraPlox EUR 24K+/year (2x cheaper, with agent governance)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The key differentiation to hammer: 'LangChain and CrewAI are not our competition — they are our distribution channel. Every company that adopts LangChain eventually needs NeuraPlox to run it in production. We sit above the frameworks and below the overpriced enterprise platforms. That is a position no one else occupies today.' On the Palantir comparison: 'Palantir makes sense if you have a Goldman Sachs budget and a 12-month implementation timeline. Our customer needs to be live in 6 weeks.' Proactively address AI commoditization: 'Models commoditize. The infrastructure and governance layer — who controls data access, who audits agent behavior — does not commoditize. That's our moat.'

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: AI commoditization risk proactively addressed — Earlybird explicit requirement; Competitive moat framed as infrastructure layer, not model performance — aligns with 'AI as infrastructure' thesis; Category creation narrative: new quadrant, not incremental improvement on existing players; Price comparison anchors value — capital-efficient customer acquisition story

*Transition: The team that identified this gap is the same team that has been building inside it for two years.*

---

## Slide 12: Built by the People Who Felt the Pain
*Type: team*

**The founders spent two years inside 25+ enterprise AI failures before writing a line of NeuraPlox code. They know exactly what needs to exist.**

- Christoph Knoell (CEO — Product, Strategy, Technology): ex-PwC Senior Manager, led M&A and IT transformation projects in the tens of millions; TÜV SÜD AI Innovator; designed multi-agent architectures across 25+ enterprise deployments
- [Firstname] Knoell (Managing Director — Operations, Finance): transformation expertise from Allianz and Oliver Wyman; runs operations, finance, and change management — the 50% human side of Operational AI
- Engineering team: 4-5 senior engineers with hands-on Kubernetes-native ML pipeline experience (multi-tenancy, Helm, ArgoCD, GitOps) validated in live customer environments
- Advisory board: 2 former Google engineering managers (names to be confirmed) — Silicon Valley engineering credibility and global talent network access
- Post-Seed hiring plan: 2-3 senior platform engineers, 1 sales/partnerships lead — EUR 2M revenue with 4-5 engineers demonstrates exceptional output-per-headcount before scaling

**Key Metrics:**
- 2 years enterprise AI deployment experience
- 25+ projects across 5+ named customers
- EUR 2M revenue, 4-5 engineers

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The founder story is the pitch within the pitch. 'Christoph didn't start NeuraWork with a platform idea. He started with a consulting engagement, then another, then another — and every single one hit the same infrastructure wall. NeuraPlox is the product he wish existed for his first project.' On the revenue per headcount: 'EUR 2M revenue with four engineers. That is not a metric we're embarrassed about — that is the metric we're most proud of. It tells you we understand the problem well enough to solve it efficiently, and it tells you the Seed goes into building the platform, not keeping the lights on.' Note: second founder's first name to be confirmed before investor meeting.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Domain expertise proof: 25+ deployments over 2 years before productizing — Earlybird's top criterion; Husband-wife founding team with complementary skills (tech + ops) — operational resilience signal; Output-per-headcount metric directly addresses capital efficiency requirement; Google engineering manager advisors signal global ambition and talent access — supports global winner thesis

*Transition: Here's the financial picture — and what the Seed specifically buys.*

---

## Slide 13: Cash-Flow Positive Today. Seed Buys Platform, Not Survival.
*Type: financials*

**Consulting revenue already covers operations. At EUR 3M raised with EUR 120-150K post-Seed burn, we have 20-24 months of runway — plus ongoing consulting as a cash cushion.**

- Current state: EUR 2M+ annual revenue (~EUR 170K/month) against ~EUR 80-100K/month operating costs — operationally cash-flow positive before Seed closes
- Post-Seed burn: EUR 120-150K/month with expanded engineering team (2-3 senior hires) — at EUR 3M raised, 20-24 months runway not counting consulting revenue
- Burn multiple: effectively 0 on consulting business (revenue exceeds costs); platform Seed burn multiple targeted at <1.5x as platform ARR builds
- Revenue trajectory: EUR 600K ARR target at 12 months post-product launch (10 customers); EUR 2.4M ARR at 24 months (40 customers); EUR 3M+ ARR at 36 months (50 customers + marketplace)

**Key Metrics:**
- Current monthly revenue: ~EUR 170K
- Current burn: ~EUR 80-100K/month (positive)
- Post-Seed runway: 20-24 months
- Burn multiple target: <1.5x

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

This is where capital efficiency becomes a competitive advantage in the room. 'We are one of the few companies you will see this year that is already cash-flow positive at the Seed stage. The EUR 3M is not survival capital — it is acceleration capital. We know exactly what it buys: platform completion, two senior engineer hires, one sales lead, and the ZIM R&D program co-funded at 45%. Exact P&L is in the data room — happy to walk through it.' The burn multiple framing is critical for Earlybird: demonstrate you know the metric and are managing to it.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Burn multiple explicitly addressed — Earlybird listed this as a key metric requirement; Cash-flow positive status is exceptional at Seed stage — directly addresses capital efficiency thesis; Revenue trajectory shown with specific customer count methodology — satisfies bottom-up preference; Consulting revenue as runway cushion reduces Seed risk profile — defensible capital efficiency story

*Transition: Here's precisely what the EUR 3M funds and the milestones it creates.*

---

## Slide 14: EUR 3M Seed — Platform Build, Not Burn
*Type: the-ask*

**EUR 3M funds 18 months of platform completion, three paying customers live, and EUR 600K ARR — with ongoing consulting revenue as a floor.**

- Raise: EUR 3M Seed (ZIM grant EUR 237K non-dilutive already secured — effective Seed capital need is EUR 3M on top of existing co-funding)
- Engineering (60%, ~EUR 1.8M): 2-3 senior platform engineers to complete 7-layer architecture and launch the Plox Marketplace; full-stack team in place within 60 days of close
- Sales & GTM (20%, ~EUR 600K): 1 sales/partnerships lead; channel partner activation in DACH and first EU-27 market; convert 3 pilot customers to paid contracts
- Operations & compliance (20%, ~EUR 600K): ISO 27001 and ISO 42001 certifications; security infrastructure; EU AI Act compliance readiness — turns regulatory pressure into competitive moat
- 18-month milestones: 7-layer platform live (Month 6) → 3 paying customers (Month 9) → EUR 600K ARR (Month 12) → EU channel partner signed (Month 15) → Series A metrics in view (Month 18)

**Key Metrics:**
- Raise: EUR 3M Seed
- Target ARR at 18 months: EUR 600K
- Non-dilutive ZIM co-funding: EUR 237K secured

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Be explicit about the milestone sequencing: 'By Month 6 the platform is complete. By Month 9 we have three paying customers — these are not cold prospects, they are the pilot customers already in our system. By Month 12 we hit EUR 600K ARR. By Month 18 we have the metrics to raise a Series A: ARR trajectory, NDR data, at least one EU channel partner live.' The non-dilutive grant is worth emphasizing: 'The German government has already invested EUR 237K in NeuraPlox through the ZIM program. That is independent technical validation, and it reduces the effective dilution of this round for you.'

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Use of funds breakdown satisfies Earlybird's explicit requirement; Non-dilutive ZIM grant signals capital efficiency and government technology validation; 18-month milestone path shows Series A readiness — Earlybird typically leads or co-leads Series A; ISO 27001/42001 certifications frame regulatory compliance as moat — European sovereignty angle

*Transition: Let me close with the technical architecture that makes the defensibility case concrete.*

---

## Slide 15: Architecture Deep Dive: Why This Cannot Be Assembled from Open Source Alone
*Type: ai-architecture*

**Open-source L1-L3 builds the community. Proprietary L4-L7 Control Plane is the moat — agent identity, 3D policy enforcement, and full observability across every action, every agent, every data touch.**

- Execution Layer (open-source, community flywheel): L1 Kubernetes-native operator + GitOps; L2 MLflow model registry + Feast feature store + pgvector/Milvus; L3 LLM gateway with provider routing + hybrid BM25/dense RAG engine with cross-encoder reranking — 15-30% better retrieval accuracy than pure vector search
- Control Plane (proprietary, the moat): L4 OpenTelemetry + Langfuse — full cost and behavior tracing per agent per request; L5 Unified Data Access with N+M connector architecture (vs N×M) + PII detection >95% precision/recall target on German business documents; L6 Policy Engine with 3D model (Who × What × Which Data) — agents as security identities, not users
- Agent Registry (L7, the ecosystem lock-in): every Plox has a lifecycle (Draft → Staging → Production → Deprecated), individual permission matrix, resource limits, and certification tier — no existing framework implements per-agent identity at the platform level
- IP strategy: L1-L3 Apache 2.0 open-source; L4-L7 proprietary, trade secret protected (GeschGehG); patent filing on 3D Policy Model and agent-identity architecture planned within 12 months of Seed close
- Commoditization defense: models are commodities — NeuraPlox is model-agnostic and routes between OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, and local open-source models; the moat is the control plane that governs agents regardless of which model they run

**Key Metrics:**
- RAG accuracy: 15-30% improvement over pure vector search (enterprise benchmark)

This slide is for the technical partner in the room — likely Dr. Andre Retterath given Earlybird's AI infrastructure focus. Lead with the strategic split: 'We open-source the bottom three layers deliberately. That is how we build a global developer community without a global sales team. The top four layers are proprietary and trade-secret protected — that is where we monetize.' On commoditization: 'GPT-5 will be better than GPT-4. Claude 4 will be better than Claude 3. We don't care — our platform routes to whoever is best and cheapest at the moment of the request. The moat is not which model runs. The moat is knowing who authorized it, what data it touched, and what it did. That cannot be commoditized.' Close with the patent signal — shows IP maturity.

> **VC Alignment**: Technical depth satisfies Dr. Retterath's AI infrastructure and developer tools focus; Open-source L1-L3 mirrors HiveMQ and other Earlybird portfolio companies' community-first moats; AI commoditization risk explicitly and credibly addressed — Earlybird explicit requirement; European data sovereignty embodied in architecture: on-premise, cloud-agnostic, PII detection, open standards; Patent filing plan signals defensibility maturity — important for 'deep tech with commercialization path' thesis

*Transition: We started with 25 enterprises hitting the same infrastructure wall. NeuraPlox is the answer — and the window to build it is now.*

## Information Gaps

The following data points were missing and could strengthen the deck:

- [ ] Second founder's first name not provided — listed as '[Vorname] Knoell' in source documents
- [ ] Exact NDR figure unavailable — using consulting repeat-engagement proxy
- [ ] Advisory board names not confirmed — listed as '2 former Google engineering managers' pending confirmation
- [ ] Gross margin on consulting business not explicitly stated — estimated 30% based on industry norms and company framing
- [ ] Exact CAC figure unavailable — all pipeline currently from existing consulting relationships (zero cold acquisition cost)
- [ ] YoY revenue growth rate not stated — Year 1 revenue baseline unknown, so YoY growth cannot be calculated
- [ ] Customer logos not confirmed as publicly referenceable — using names from neuraplox_updates.md as instructed
- [ ] ACV per named customer not broken out — using average ACV of EUR 60K from company plan
- [ ] Exact payback period not calculable without CAC
- [ ] LTV not calculable without exact churn rate — using land-and-expand model assumption
