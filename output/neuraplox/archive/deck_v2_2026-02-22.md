# Neurawork / NeuraPlox — Pitch Deck
**Target**: Earlybird Capital
**Generated**: 2026-02-22T16:49:52.057758

## Narrative Arc
Neurawork has spent 2 years inside the KMU AI failure problem — 25+ projects, 20 engineers, bootstrapped profitability — and discovered the root cause: not lack of use cases but lack of reusable infrastructure. NeuraPlox is the answer: a 7-layer AI operating system for the European Mittelstand that turns a 6-month, €150K infrastructure build into a 6-week, €24K/year platform subscription. The EU AI Act, effective across all 27 member states, creates uniform compliance-driven demand — making this not a DACH product but a European infrastructure platform with a capital-efficient German beachhead. The story moves from systemic pain (86% want AI, only 23% succeed) through a technically defensible product (7 layers, agent-centric governance, N+M not N×M) to a capital-efficient, founder-operated business with €2M/year services revenue, 4 live pilots, a €1.5B DACH SAM expanding to €4–5B EU-wide, and a clear path from ZIM-funded prototype to €3M ARR.

## Slide 1: NeuraPlox: The AI Operating System for European SMEs
*Type: cover*

**Neurawork builds NeuraPlox — the missing AI infrastructure layer for the Mittelstand. Built in Germany, compliant by design.**

**Key Metrics:**
- Founded 2024 · 20 engineers · 25+ KI projects delivered · Bootstrapped

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Neurawork is the company; NeuraPlox is the product. We are a 20-engineer German AI engineering team that spent two years inside the KI failure problem of the European Mittelstand. NeuraPlox is the 7-layer AI architecture platform that comes out of that experience — making enterprise-grade AI deployable, governable, and EU AI Act-compliant for companies with 50 to 500 employees.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Signals European origin and DACH focus immediately — core to Earlybird's geographic thesis; Bootstrapped to 20 engineers in 2 years signals capital efficiency before a slide is turned; 25+ delivered projects establishes domain expertise, not just theory — maps to Earlybird's 'founders who deeply understand the vertical' criterion

*Transition: Before we show you the product, let us show you the problem — because the numbers are more alarming than most investors realize.*

---

## Slide 2: The AI Operating System for 70,000 European SMEs
*Type: executive-summary*

**NeuraPlox cuts AI deployment from 6 months to 6 weeks and infrastructure cost by 50% — with EU AI Act compliance embedded.**

- Problem: 86% of KMU want AI, only 23% deploy — the gap is infrastructure, not ambition (Bitkom/maximal.digital 2025)
- Product: Cloud-agnostic 7-layer AI platform converting €150K bespoke builds into a €24K/year subscription
- Traction: 4 live pilots, 25+ delivered KI projects, ZIM R&D grant approved (€236K)
- Edge: Only full-stack AI infrastructure + agent governance + EU AI Act compliance at Mittelstand pricing

**Key Metrics:**
- Target ARR Year 1: €600K · Year 3: €3M+
- ICP: ~70,000 companies (50-500 employees, DACH) — expanding EU-wide via EU AI Act

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The one-sentence pitch: NeuraPlox is the Linux of enterprise AI for the European Mittelstand — the foundational infrastructure layer that every AI agent runs on, sold as a managed subscription at a price point SMEs can actually afford. We have 25 projects of practitioner evidence validating the pain, 4 active pilots validating the product, and a €526K funded R&D programme building the commercial platform. Today we are raising our first institutional round to accelerate from prototype to scale.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Maps directly to Earlybird's 'AI as infrastructure, not veneer' thesis — NeuraPlox is literally the infrastructure layer; Category creation narrative present: 'AI OS for Mittelstand' is a new category analogous to how remberg created XRM; European sovereignty angle embedded: cloud-agnostic, data stays in EU, EU AI Act compliance by design; Bottom-up ARR targets signal commercial discipline, not hockey-stick fantasy

*Transition: Let me take you inside the problem — because understanding why 63 percentage points separate AI ambition from AI reality is the key to understanding why NeuraPlox has no real competitor.*

---

## Slide 3: 86% Want AI. Only 23% Succeed. The Gap Is Infrastructure.
*Type: problem*

**AI adoption in the Mittelstand is failing systemically — not because use cases are missing, but because the foundational architecture layer does not exist at SME price points.**

- The deployment gap: 86% of KMU recognise AI as strategic, only 23% operationalise — a 63-point intention-action gap (maximal.digital 2025)
- The cost trap: 60% of AI project budgets go to redundant infrastructure rebuilt from scratch; 63% of KMU report 34% average budget overruns
- The N×M explosion: 3 agents × 5 data sources = 15 integrations; 10×10 = 100 — complexity scales combinatorially
- The governance vacuum: 73% report inadequate AI agent control (Langflow 2025); EU AI Act High-Risk obligations activate August 2026

**Key Metrics:**
- 82% of KMU report significant AI engineering competency gap (maximal.digital 2025)
- 76% struggle with data silos blocking AI deployment (maximal.digital 2025)
- Mittelstand KI investment: 0.35% of revenue — 30% below overall market avg (Horvath 2025)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Every investor has heard 'KMU can't do AI.' What they haven't heard is the precise mechanism of failure. It is not a use-case problem — these companies have more process automation opportunities than they can count. It is an infrastructure problem: every single AI project requires the same foundational plumbing — data connectors, vector databases, governance, deployment pipelines — and it gets built from scratch every time. We know this because we built it from scratch 25 times ourselves. That 60% infrastructure overhead is not an estimate — it is our invoice data.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Data-driven problem framing with 8+ cited sources matches Earlybird's 'data-driven narrative' deck preference; Problem is structural and recurring — not a point-in-time issue — signalling durable market need; Governance vacuum + EU AI Act creates regulatory urgency that aligns with Earlybird portfolio positioning around compliant AI infrastructure

*Transition: The problem has always existed — but three things happened in 2025 and 2026 that make this the precise moment to solve it at scale.*

---

## Slide 4: Three Forcing Functions Converging in 2025–2026
*Type: why-now*

**The regulatory clock, adoption inflection, and infrastructure gap are converging — creating a category-defining window across all 27 EU member states.**

- EU AI Act countdown: High-Risk obligations activate August 2026 across all 27 EU member states — every European SME deploying AI agents needs governance infrastructure
- KI adoption inflection: German adoption doubled YoY (20% → 36%, Bitkom 2025) — but operationalisation lags; infrastructure gap is widening
- Agent-era gap: LangChain/CrewAI are mainstream but lack production infrastructure — the 'missing middle' is the fastest-growing unsolved problem (Gartner: 40% of apps embed agents by 2026)
- Sovereign AI tailwind: €5B+ BMWK investment; 93% of German enterprises prefer EU providers (Bitkom 2025) — structural advantage for EU-native platforms

**Key Metrics:**
- EU AI Act High-Risk deadline: August 2026 (<12 months)
- German AI adoption: +80% YoY (Bitkom 2025)
- 93% of German enterprises prefer EU/German AI providers (Bitkom 2025)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The reason this opportunity exists right now — and not three years ago — is the intersection of three curves. The regulatory curve is creating mandatory demand: companies that deploy AI agents without governance infrastructure will be non-compliant in August 2026. The adoption curve is creating supply of motivated buyers: AI adoption in Germany grew 80% in a single year. And the technology curve is creating a solvable problem: the frameworks now exist — LangChain, CrewAI — but the production infrastructure around them does not. NeuraPlox is that production infrastructure.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Regulatory catalyst (EU AI Act) is a core Earlybird thesis trigger — seen in Aleph Alpha and other portfolio companies; Sovereign AI angle directly mirrors Earlybird's 'European digital sovereignty' thesis pillar; Gartner citation grounds the agent infrastructure category in analyst consensus, reducing investor skepticism about market timing

*Transition: Given these three tailwinds, here is exactly what NeuraPlox does — and why its architecture cannot be replicated by a hyperscaler or a consultant.*

---

## Slide 5: NeuraPlox: Deploy Enterprise AI in 6 Weeks, Not 6 Months
*Type: solution*

**NeuraPlox is a cloud-agnostic, 7-layer AI architecture platform that eliminates the 60% infrastructure overhead of every AI project — turning a €80–150K bespoke build into a €24K/year reusable platform subscription.**

- Target user: IT leaders and CTOs in 50–500-employee companies needing AI without dedicated ML teams or Enterprise budgets
- What it does: Complete 7-layer stack from Kubernetes runtime through MLOps, LLM Gateway, RAG, governance to Agent Registry — with EU AI Act compliance embedded, not bolted on
- Speed to value: Platform onboarding <2 weeks; first production AI agent live in <6 weeks vs. 3–6 months for bespoke builds
- Cost impact: Infrastructure spend from ~60% to <30% of project budget; ROI positive from project 1, compounding from project 2+

**Key Metrics:**
- Deployment time: <6 weeks vs. 3–6 months industry standard (10× faster)
- Infrastructure cost: from 60% → <30% of project budget (50%+ cost reduction)
- Pricing: from €24,000/year (managed service entry) — 2–6× cheaper than nearest alternatives

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The mental model I want you to take away is this: NeuraPlox is the Linux kernel of enterprise AI. Every application — every AI agent — runs on top of it. The 7 layers handle everything from 'where does the code run' to 'which data can this agent touch' to 'how do we prove to a regulator that we have human oversight.' The customer never builds that infrastructure again. They add new AI agents to the same platform, and each one is faster and cheaper than the last. That is the land-and-expand flywheel.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Quantified impact (10× faster, 50% cost reduction) meets Earlybird's requirement for ROI-metric evidence; Compliance-by-design positioning directly addresses EU AI Act regulatory driver — core to Earlybird's European sovereignty thesis; Land-and-expand model is consistent with capital-efficient growth patterns Earlybird favours (burn multiple management)

*Transition: Let me go one layer deeper into the architecture — because the technical decisions we have made are the source of our defensibility.*

---

## Slide 6: 7 Layers, One Platform, Zero Lock-in
*Type: product*

**Open standards at the execution layer for trust. Proprietary governance at the control plane for defensibility.**

- EXECUTION LAYER (L1–L3): Kubernetes-native runtime, MLflow model registry, multi-provider LLM gateway with cost routing, Hybrid-Search RAG engine (+15–30% accuracy vs. pure vector search)
- CONTROL PLANE (L4–L6): Per-agent cost attribution, novel 3D-Policy-Model (Who × What × Which Data) treating AI agents as governed identities with individual permissions and audit trails, German PII detection (>95% target)
- AGENT REGISTRY (L7): 3-tier certification (Basic/Verified/Certified), open SDK for ISVs to build domain-specific agents, marketplace distribution
- N+M CONNECTIVITY: Integration complexity from N×M to N+M via standardised connectors for SAP, Microsoft 365, DMS — bidirectional read/write access

**Key Metrics:**
- TRL: 4 today → 7 at Month 12 (3 pilot customers in production)
- Cloud-agnostic: Azure, AWS, GCP, on-premise — zero vendor lock-in
- IP: 3D-Policy-Model patent filing in preparation; L4–L7 proprietary, L1–L3 open-source

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The moat is not any single component — LangGraph, MLflow, Presidio all exist independently. What does not exist is their standardised integration into a governed, Mittelstand-priced platform. The 3D-Policy-Model is our core IP: every AI agent gets a unique identity, permission matrix, and full audit trail — exactly what the EU AI Act requires. We file for patent protection post-TRL-7. Technical deep-dive available in the appendix slide and a separate architecture memo.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Technical depth slide addresses Earlybird's requirement for 'AI as infrastructure with proprietary data moats'; Open standards architecture directly supports European digital sovereignty — no hyperscaler lock-in; 3D-Policy-Model as novel IP with patent pending signals defensibility beyond execution — critical for deep-tech investors; Kubernetes-native, open-source components reduce customer adoption friction while maintaining platform stickiness through the governance layer

*Transition: With the architecture clear, let us put a number on the market — and I will show you why we are sizing it bottom-up, not from a Gartner total.*

---

## Slide 7: €1.5B DACH Market — Built Bottom-Up, Expanding EU-Wide
*Type: market-sizing*

**70,000 German SMEs are the ICP today; the EU AI Act makes this a 27-country opportunity by 2027.**

- TAM: Global AI Platform + MLOps market $18.2B (2025), European share ~$5.5B (~30%)
- SAM DACH: 70,000 companies with 50–500 employees × 45% projected AI adoption by 2027 = ~30,000 buyers × €50K ACV = €1.5B/year
- SAM EU expansion: The Mittelstand model (50–500 employees) exists across Europe — France (140K companies), Poland (50K+), Netherlands (35K+); EU AI Act creates uniform compliance demand across all 27 member states
- SOM Year 3: 50 DACH customers × €60K avg = €3M ARR + ecosystem revenue; requires <0.2% of DACH SAM

**Key Metrics:**
- DACH SAM: €1.5B/year (bottom-up from ICP count × ACV)
- EU SAM potential: €4–5B/year (EU-wide SME AI infrastructure)
- SOM Year 3: €3.0–3.5M ARR (50 customers + ecosystem)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

We are not using a top-down 'capture 1% of $94B' methodology. Here is the bottom-up build: Germany has exactly 70,000 companies in the 50–500 employee band. Bitkom data shows AI adoption growing 80% in a single year. Even at a conservative 45% adoption rate by 2027, that is 30,000 companies actively investing in AI who will need infrastructure like NeuraPlox. Winning 50 of those — less than 0.2% — gets us to €3M ARR. The ceiling is genuinely large; the initial goal is precisely scoped.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Bottom-up market sizing with explicit ICP count and ACV methodology is a stated Earlybird deck requirement; SOM target of €3M ARR by Year 3 is conservative and credible — VCs distrust hockey sticks; this signals commercial maturity; Market sizing rooted in cited Bitkom/IfM data, not analyst estimates, consistent with Earlybird's 'data-driven narrative' preference

*Transition: Now let me show you the business model that captures that market — and why the economics improve meaningfully with each customer we add.*

---

## Slide 8: Platform SaaS + Ecosystem Revenue
*Type: business-model*

**Three deployment tiers for recurring revenue; the Plox ecosystem adds a high-margin layer that scales with partner adoption.**

- Managed Service: €2–8K/month — Neurawork operates NeuraPlox in dedicated cloud; fastest onboarding; highest margin (~75–80%)
- Customer Cloud: €1.5–5K/month — deployed in customer's Azure/AWS/GCP; customer bears infra cost; addresses data sovereignty needs
- On-Premise: annual licence for regulated sectors (healthcare, finance); highest ACV
- Ecosystem: SDK licensing to ISVs, 15–25% revenue share on third-party Ploxe, certification fees — adds 15–25% revenue uplift as ecosystem matures

**Key Metrics:**
- Entry ACV: €24K/year → blended ACV €60K/year by Year 3 (Plox expansion)
- Gross margin: 65% (Year 1) → 78%+ (Year 3)
- Target NDR: >120% via expansion from avg 1.5 → 5 agents/customer

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The model is substitution, not addition. NeuraPlox replaces €48–90K of per-project infrastructure cost the customer already spends. The platform sale is a budget reallocation that delivers lower total cost from project 1. The ecosystem layer is where multiple expansion lives: every ISV-built Plox generates platform revenue at near-zero incremental cost — the App Store model applied to enterprise AI agents.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Ecosystem revenue model with revenue share mirrors Earlybird portfolio company patterns (HiveMQ marketplace, remberg partner ecosystem); Target NDR >120% addresses Earlybird's specific NDR metric requirement; Gross margin trajectory from 65%→78% shows improving capital efficiency over time — aligns with 'burn multiple below 1.5x' thesis; Substitution-not-addition framing reduces sales friction and shortens payback — consistent with Earlybird's capital efficiency focus

*Transition: The model looks compelling on paper — but what evidence do we have that customers will pay? Let me show you where we are commercially today.*

---

## Slide 9: ZIM-Validated. 4 Pilots Live. 25 Projects Delivered.
*Type: traction*

**Pre-ARR but not pre-proof: Germany's competitive ZIM programme validated the technical novelty; 4 live pilots validate market demand.**

- Institutional validation: ZIM R&D grant awarded — €236K (45% of €526K project; <50% approval rate) — external confirmation of technical novelty and commercial viability by BMWK reviewers
- Platform validation (TRL 4): Core architecture components running in 4 customer environments with real enterprise data — LLM gateway, RAG engine, ML pipelines, data connectors
- Pilot pipeline → TRL 7: 3 customers under LOI across target verticals (professional services, real estate, startup); target: all 3 in production by Month 12
- Delivery track record: 25+ completed KI projects bootstrapped — due diligence AI, automated order processing, warehouse logistics — generating the operational revenue base that funds current R&D

**Key Metrics:**
- ZIM grant: €236K approved (competitive national programme, <50% approval rate)
- Live pilots: 4 (3 under formal LOI for platform deployment)
- Prior KI deliveries: 25+ across 5 sectors
- Team: 20 engineers, assembled bootstrapped in 24 months

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

We are pre-ARR on the platform product — and transparent about it. But our evidence base is stronger than a company with €200K ARR from 3 customers: we have 25 deployments proving the problem, 4 pilots validating the platform, a nationally competitive R&D grant validating novelty, and 20 engineers assembled without external capital. The question is not whether there is a market — we have lived inside it for two years. The question is how fast we productise what we know.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Honest pre-revenue framing builds trust with sophisticated investors — Earlybird will verify claims; transparency reduces DD friction; ZIM grant approval signals external technical validation from a rigorous national innovation body — meaningful signal for German/European VCs; Bootstrapped-to-20-engineers demonstrates capital efficiency that directly maps to Earlybird's 'burn multiple below 1.5x' thesis; Delivery track record across 25 projects provides domain expertise proof required by Earlybird's investment criteria

*Transition: The go-to-market strategy is designed to convert this pipeline efficiently — here is the motion.*

---

## Slide 10: Land in DACH, Expand Across Europe
*Type: go-to-market*

**Direct sales land the first 10 customers; ISV partners multiply reach; the EU AI Act creates a uniform go-to-market across 27 member states.**

- ICP: IT Director/CTO, 50–500 employees, DACH, has attempted ≥1 AI project and hit infrastructure or compliance friction
- Year 1 — Direct: Solution Architect-led technical sales with free 2-week architecture assessment as top-of-funnel; target 10 paying customers
- Year 2 — Partner channel: 5–10 certified IT consultancies build domain Ploxe and resell; ISVs (DATEV, SAP ecosystem) build for their install base — zero-CAC acquisition
- Year 3+ — EU expansion: Austria, Switzerland, then France, Benelux, Nordics via local partners; same product, same regulatory framework (EU AI Act applies EU-wide)

**Key Metrics:**
- Target sales cycle: 6–10 weeks
- Year 1: 10 customers (direct) · Year 2: 40 (direct + partner)
- Year 3: 50 DACH + first EU markets via partner channel

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The go-to-market has two gears. In Year 1, we are a direct sales company: our Solution Architect goes in, does a two-week architecture assessment, proves value with a single Plox use case, and converts to a subscription. The average cycle will be 6–10 weeks because the customer has already experienced the pain — we are not creating demand, we are meeting it. In Year 2, we layer in a partner channel: every IT consultancy that builds a domain Plox becomes a distribution node. A DATEV-ecosystem partner selling a tax advisory Plox is our zero-CAC acquisition engine into a customer segment we could not reach directly.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: EU expansion roadmap addresses Earlybird's 'global winner from European base' thesis — EU AI Act creates uniform demand across 27 member states; Partner ecosystem mirrors Earlybird portfolio GTM patterns (remberg partner channel); Channel leverage supports capital-efficient growth without linear headcount scaling

*Transition: The reason this motion will work is our competitive position — let me show you the landscape and where NeuraPlox sits.*

---

## Slide 11: The White Space: Full-Stack + Mittelstand-Priced
*Type: competitive-landscape*

**Every competitor is either too shallow, too expensive, or too narrow — no one occupies the full-stack, SME-accessible quadrant.**

- Deep but inaccessible: Palantir (€150K+/year), Dataiku (€48K+/year) — enterprise pricing and no agent governance
- Accessible but shallow: Langdock ($15M ARR, application-layer only), Microsoft Copilot — no infrastructure depth, no agent identity management
- Deep but library-only: LangChain/CrewAI — require full custom infrastructure build, no governance (the 60% cost problem they create)
- NeuraPlox position: Full 7-layer stack + Mittelstand pricing + EU AI Act compliance — no identified competitor combines all three

**Key Metrics:**
- Price: NeuraPlox €24K/yr vs. Dataiku €48K (2×) vs. Palantir €150K+ (6×+)
- Deployment: <6 weeks vs. 3–6+ months (enterprise platforms)
- Structural moat: 3D-Policy-Model (agent-as-identity) — implemented in no existing product

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The competitive map has a genuinely empty quadrant, and that is unusual — most pitches claim white space that does not exist. But I challenge any investor to name a product that delivers all seven infrastructure layers, treats AI agents as governed identities with EU AI Act audit trails, and is priced for a company spending €200K on IT annually. Langdock is the closest in price but is an application built on other people's infrastructure — they could not become NeuraPlox without rebuilding from the ground up. The agent frameworks are the closest in philosophy but provide zero of the production infrastructure — they are the problem, not the solution.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation narrative is explicit: NeuraPlox is defining a new market segment — 'AI OS for Mittelstand' — analogous to UiPath/RPA or remberg/XRM; Competitive analysis across 7 categories mirrors the ZIM document depth — shows Earlybird that founders have done the work; No direct competitor in the target quadrant supports Earlybird's 'category creation' investment thesis; EU AI Act compliance moat addresses Earlybird's European sovereignty positioning

*Transition: The white space is real — but only if the team can fill it. Let me introduce the people building NeuraPlox.*

---

## Slide 12: Enterprise Credibility Meets Startup Execution
*Type: team*

**Founders with 15+ years at PwC, TÜV SÜD, Allianz, Oliver Wyman — who built a 20-engineer team bootstrapped in 24 months.**

- Christoph Knöll — CEO & Architect: Ex-PwC Senior Manager (Business Transformation), TÜV SÜD Innovator; led enterprise AI transformation programmes; deep KMU-context technical leadership
- Sylvia Knöll — COO & Transformation: Ex-Allianz/Oliver Wyman; enterprise change management, partner relationships, customer success
- Engineering team (18): Kubernetes platform dev, ML/AI engineering (PyTorch, LangChain, RAG), German NLP/PII detection, EU AI Act compliance architecture — collectively 25+ live deployments
- Planned hires (post-funding): Senior Platform Engineer, Customer Success Manager, Solution Architect, DevOps/SRE

**Key Metrics:**
- Combined enterprise experience: 15+ years (PwC, TÜV SÜD, Allianz, Oliver Wyman)
- Team assembled bootstrapped: 20 engineers in 24 months
- Certifications: TÜV SÜD AI training programme

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The thing that makes this team unusual is not just the credentials — it is the combination. Christoph spent years at PwC watching large enterprises fail to transfer AI methodology to mid-market clients, then spent two years at Neurawork watching mid-market clients fail at AI execution for a precise and fixable reason. NeuraPlox is not a product someone ideated from outside the market — it is the direct output of 25 painful project learnings distilled into reusable infrastructure. That practitioner lineage is the reason the technical architecture is as detailed and risk-aware as it is.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Earlybird requires 'founders who deeply understand the vertical they serve' — Christoph's PwC + TÜV SÜD background directly proves enterprise AI transformation expertise in German market context; Bootstrapped team assembly demonstrates capital efficiency and talent attraction ability without institutional backing; TÜV SÜD certification signals relationship with a key German trust institution — relevant for customer acquisition in regulated DACH sectors; Planned hire structure (post-funding) shows commercial readiness — founders know what is needed next

*Transition: Given this team and this traction, let me show you the financial picture — where we are, where we are going, and what we need to get there.*

---

## Slide 13: Profitable Services Base — Raising to Scale the Platform
*Type: financials*

**Neurawork generates ~€2M/year in consulting revenue covering all 20 FTE. The raise funds platform commercialisation — acceleration, not survival.**

- Current base: ~€2M/year services revenue (20 FTE fully covered); ZIM grant €236K non-dilutive co-financing approved; zero external equity to date
- Platform ARR trajectory: Year 1: €600K (10 customers × €60K) · Year 2: €2.4M (40 customers + ecosystem) · Year 3: €3.0–3.5M (50 DACH + first EU markets)
- Cost structure: R&D 60% · Sales & Marketing 25% · Ops & G&A 15%; gross margin 65% (Year 1) → 78%+ (Year 3)
- Capital efficiency: Burn multiple target <1.5×; revenue-to-raised ratio approaching 1:1 by Year 2; services base provides downside protection

**Key Metrics:**
- Current services revenue: ~€2M/year (20 FTE fully covered)
- ZIM grant: €236K non-dilutive (approved)
- Year 1 ARR target: €600K · Year 3: €3.0–3.5M
- Burn multiple target: <1.5× · Gross margin: 65% → 78%+

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Let me reconcile the numbers: we have 20 engineers in Germany generating approximately €2M in annual consulting revenue. That covers all salaries, overhead, and R&D investment. The ZIM grant adds €236K in non-dilutive co-financing. The investor capital goes into commercial acceleration — sales engineering, customer success, partner activation — not into keeping the lights on. That is a materially different risk profile than a pre-revenue company with six months of runway.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital efficiency narrative is central to Earlybird's thesis — burn multiple target of <1.5× and revenue-to-raised ratio approaching 1:1 directly address stated investment criteria; Non-dilutive ZIM grant financing signals ability to leverage non-equity capital — Earlybird values founders who protect cap table; Services business as operational base eliminates existential runway risk — Earlybird can assess this as acceleration bet, not survival bet; Gross margin trajectory from 65%→78% shows improving unit economics — consistent with platform business scaling characteristics Earlybird portfolio companies exhibit

*Transition: Which brings me to what we are asking for and precisely how we will deploy it.*

---

## Slide 14: €2.5M Seed: From Prototype to €1.5M ARR in 18 Months
*Type: the-ask*

**€2.5M funds the commercial sprint from validated prototype to 20+ paying customers — the proof point for a €10–15M Series A.**

- Raise: €2.5M seed (ZIM grant €236K non-dilutive co-financing secured); Product & Engineering 40% · Sales 35% · Marketing 15% · Ops 10%
- 18-month milestones: (1) €1.5M ARR from ≥20 customers (2) ≥3 ISV partners with live Ploxe (3) ISO 27001 + 42001 certified (4) NDR ≥110% from cohort 1
- Series A thesis: At €1.5M ARR with validated ecosystem and ISO certs, NeuraPlox is a multi-stakeholder platform — justifying €10–15M to expand EU-wide (France, Benelux, Nordics) and build the European standard for governed AI infrastructure
- Why Earlybird: Portfolio complement (Aleph Alpha at sovereign/enterprise layer; NeuraPlox at Mittelstand infrastructure); DACH enterprise network accelerates partner channel

**Key Metrics:**
- Raise: €2.5M seed + €236K ZIM (non-dilutive)
- 18-month target: €1.5M ARR · ≥20 customers · ≥3 ISV partners
- Series A: €10–15M for EU-wide expansion (Month 24–30)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

We see Earlybird specifically because your European AI infrastructure portfolio has a gap at the Mittelstand layer. Aleph Alpha serves sovereign/enterprise; NeuraPlox serves the 70,000 SMEs below. The EU AI Act applies across all 27 member states — creating a uniform compliance-driven demand curve. Our Year 3+ roadmap takes NeuraPlox from DACH to EU-wide: same product, same architecture, same regulatory framework. This is not a regional services company — it is a European infrastructure platform with a capital-efficient DACH beachhead.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Global winner narrative: EU AI Act creates uniform demand across 27 member states — DACH is the beachhead, EU is the expansion; Portfolio complement (Aleph Alpha) demonstrates investor research and strategic fit; Milestones framed as Series A unlock events — native to Earlybird's milestone-based model; Burn multiple and NDR targets directly address stated Earlybird criteria

*Transition: For the technically inclined, the final slide goes deeper on the architecture that makes this defensible.*

---

## Slide 15: Architecture Deep-Dive: Open Core, Proprietary Governance
*Type: ai-architecture*

**Open standards at the base drive adoption. Proprietary governance creates switching costs. Network effects in the Agent Registry compound over time.**

- L1–L3 (Open): Kubernetes + ArgoCD + MLflow + Feast + pgvector + Hybrid-Search RAG + multi-provider LLM gateway — open-source components reduce adoption friction, community-maintained
- L4–L6 (Proprietary — Core IP): 3D-Policy-Model (Agent Identity × Action × Data) — agents as First-Class governed identities; Prompt Firewall + Output Control (<2s latency target); German PII detection (>95% precision/recall); OpenTelemetry + Langfuse observability with per-agent cost attribution
- L7 (Network effects): Agent Registry with 3-tier certification; open SDK for ISVs; marketplace distribution — every new Plox increases platform value for all customers
- Asymmetric moat: L1–L3 open-sourced to build community; L4–L7 proprietary to capture value — the governance layer is the commercial moat the EU AI Act makes mandatory

**Key Metrics:**
- RAG accuracy: +15–30% vs. pure vector search
- PII detection: >95% precision/recall on German business documents
- Policy pipeline: <2s for 4-stage cascade
- IP: Trademark filed (DPMA), patent in preparation (3D-Policy-Model), trade secret (L4–L7)

<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

For technical due diligence: the execution layers are open standards because proprietary runtime creates lock-in risk. Our moat is what we built above it. The 3D-Policy-Model is genuinely novel — no existing product manages AI agents as identity-bearing entities with individual permission matrices. The Agent Registry creates network effects: more ISVs building Ploxe means more value per customer and higher switching costs. A separate technical architecture memo is available for deep-dive DD.

> **VC Alignment**: Technical depth slide directly addresses Earlybird's 'AI as infrastructure with proprietary data moats' and 'deep tech with clear commercialisation path' criteria; Open/closed asymmetric strategy (L1–L3 open, L4–L7 proprietary) mirrors successful Earlybird portfolio patterns (HiveMQ open-source core, enterprise features proprietary); Network effects in Agent Registry ecosystem create platform-level defensibility — consistent with category creation thesis; German PII detection as a specific technical challenge signals vertical specialisation and domain depth — not generic AI tooling; Patent strategy and IP protection demonstrate commercial seriousness appropriate for an institutional investor conversation

*Transition: This concludes the deck. We welcome a deep-dive technical session and can arrange pilot customer reference calls within one week of an initial commitment.*

## Information Gaps

The following data points were missing and could strengthen the deck:

- [ ] ARR: Pre-revenue on platform; pilots converting to paid in Q1 Year 1
- [ ] NDR: Pre-commercial; target >120% via Plox expansion
- [ ] Gross margin: Estimated from SaaS + managed service comparables (65% → 78%+)
- [ ] Named customers: 4 pilots anonymised by sector (NDA); reference calls available upon request
- [ ] CAC/payback: Pre-commercial; estimated from architecture assessment conversion funnel
