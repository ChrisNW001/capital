# NeuraPlox — Pitch Deck
**Target**: Earlybird Capital
**Generated**: 2026-02-26T19:55:03.168035

## Narrative Arc
Hook (Slides 1-3): NeuraPlox opens with a category-creation hook — the Agent OS for Europe — then establishes urgent structural pain (N×M tax, governance gap, regulatory deadline) before delivering the 30-second thesis with SAP analogy, traction proof, and business model summary. Resolution (Slides 4-5): The N+M architecture resolves the pain and 3D-Policy governance unlocks enterprise production deployment. Proof (Slides 6-8): Why-now timing (EU AI Act, LLM costs, sovereignty tailwind), competitive whitespace (no one else governs agents at Mittelstand price), and traction (>€1M revenue, ZIM validation, four pilots, ~150% NDR proxy, quantified customer ROI). Business (Slides 9-12): Three-horizon business model with 30%→70%→80%+ gross margin trajectory, €1.5B DACH SAM with bottom-up methodology, capital-efficient GTM via consulting pipeline, and a revenue flywheel that scales internationally. Close (Slides 13-15): Team with 25+ deployment unfair advantage, defended €2M ask with Series A bridge, and a closing that lands European sovereignty as the enduring thesis.

## Slide 1: NeuraPlox — The AI Operating System for Enterprises
*Type: cover*

**Where agents build their own interfaces. Governance-safe by design.**

**Key Metrics:**
- Neurawork GmbH & Co. KG | Founded 2024 | 15 employees
- Seed Round | Christoph Knöll | kontakt@neurawork.de

<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Open with the one-liner and let it land: 'We are building the operating system that every enterprise will run their AI agents on.' Do not over-explain on this slide. The subtitle — governance-safe by design — signals immediately that we solve the production deployment problem, not just the demo problem. The SAP-era framing sets category ambition before the first slide turn.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: 'Agent OS' as a new category mirrors how UiPath named RPA and remberg named XRM — Earlybird's hallmark investment pattern; European digital sovereignty: company name, founding location, and subtitle all signal European-first infrastructure; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: governance-safe framing signals applied AI, not pure research

*Transition: Before we show you what the OS looks like, let us show you exactly why enterprises cannot get AI into production without it.*

---

## Slide 2: Enterprise AI is Stuck Between PoC and Production
*Type: problem*

**The Mittelstand is willing but structurally blocked. Three compounding failures create a €1.5B infrastructure gap.**

- THE N×M TAX: Every agent needs custom connections to every data source — 60% of KI project costs go to redundant infrastructure. 63% of KMU report cost overruns averaging 34%.
- NO GOVERNANCE = NO DEPLOYMENT: Without compliance and auditability, nothing reaches production. EU AI Act mandates governance for high-risk systems by August 2026.
- VENDOR LOCK-IN: Hyperscalers prohibit switching; Palantir/Dataiku price out the Mittelstand. Agent frameworks offer no deployment or governance path.
- THE GAP: 86% of KMU recognize AI's strategic relevance — only 23% have operationalized it. A 63-point intention-action gap.

**Key Metrics:**
- 86% of KMU recognize AI strategic relevance — only 23% operationalized (maximal.digital 2025)
- 73% of enterprises: inadequate AI agent governance (Langflow/DataStax 2025)
- 60% of KI project costs: redundant infrastructure, not value creation

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Frame this as structural failure, not a skills gap. The Mittelstand is not failing because it lacks ambition — it lacks architecture. The N×M problem is combinatorially explosive: it compounds with every new agent and data source, which is why point solutions cannot solve it. The governance problem is existential: without it, nothing goes to production. The regulatory clock makes this urgent — August 2026 is not far away, and ad-hoc implementations will not be compliant. Every consulting project we run confirms this: enterprises are buying consultants to solve an infrastructure problem that should be solved by a platform.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: European digital sovereignty: US lock-in pain (hyperscaler vendor trap) is a direct sovereignty concern for German enterprises; AI as infrastructure not veneer: the PoC graveyard framing validates that AI needs real infrastructure, not more demos; Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: data sourced from German-specific market research (Bitkom, maximal.digital, Horvath)

*Transition: This is the structural failure. Now here is our vision for how to solve it — one OS where any agent connects to any system, automatically.*

---

## Slide 3: SAP for the AI Era — One OS, Any Agent, Any System
*Type: executive-summary*

**NeuraPlox eliminates N×M integration complexity and makes AI agents production-safe — the missing infrastructure layer for 70,000 Mittelstand companies.**

- CATEGORY: Agent OS — the infrastructure running all AI agents. N×M integrations reduced to N+M.
- MOAT: Proprietary 3D-Policy governance (WHO × WHAT × WHICH DATA) — EU AI Act compliant by design.
- TRACTION: 25+ projects, >€1M consulting revenue, €237K ZIM grant, four live pilots. Financial services beachhead.
- BUSINESS: Consulting (30% GM) → SaaS (70%) → Marketplace (80%+). Year 3: €3M ARR. €2M Seed.

**Key Metrics:**
- 25+ enterprise projects delivered
- €237,375 ZIM grant (45% R&D co-funded)
- Target ACV: €24K–€60K | Year 3 SOM: €3M ARR

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

This is the 30-second filter slide. Lead with the SAP analogy: SAP unified fragmented enterprise operations; NeuraPlox unifies fragmented AI agents. The consulting revenue >€1M signals capital efficiency from day one. Financial services as beachhead shows vertical depth, not horizontal consulting.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: explicit SAP analogy positions this as a new market category, not a feature; Capital-efficient growth: ZIM grant covers 45% of core R&D — government-validated and co-funded; AI as infrastructure not veneer: N+M framing shows proprietary architectural moat, not wrapper; European digital sovereignty: Mittelstand focus, German grant, EU AI Act compliance as product feature

*Transition: That is the 30-second thesis. Now let us go deeper on the architecture that makes this real.*

---

## Slide 4: N+M Architecture: Agents Connect to Any System Automatically
*Type: solution*

**Agents auto-create their own IT interfaces — N×M becomes N+M, with governance gating every action.**

- HOW IT WORKS: Agents declare what they need → platform resolves connections automatically → governance gates every action → full audit trail. Zero custom integrations.
- N+M BREAKTHROUGH: N agents + M data sources = N+M connections, not N×M. Three core connectors (Microsoft 365, SAP, DMS) cover 80% of Mittelstand data needs.
- GOVERNANCE AS UNLOCK: WHO can do WHAT with WHICH DATA. Every agent has its own permission matrix and audit trail. EU AI Act compliant by architecture.
- IMPACT: Infrastructure cost 60% → <30%. Implementation 3–6 months → <6 weeks. Entry €24K/year vs. Palantir €150K+.
- MOAT: As AI models commoditize, governance + integration becomes MORE valuable. Every new agent makes connectors more valuable; every new connector makes agents more capable.

**Key Metrics:**
- Infrastructure cost: 60% → <30% of project cost
- Implementation time: 3–6 months → <6 weeks
- Entry ACV: €24K/year vs. Palantir €150K+/year (6–10× cheaper)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Resist the urge to walk through the 7-layer architecture — investors need to understand what it DOES, not how it is built. The N+M metaphor is the most powerful concept in the deck: make the investor feel the combinatorial explosion of N×M, then show the elegance of N+M. The governance angle is the production unlock — no enterprise will deploy agents in production without it, and no other platform has agent-centric governance built in. The AI commoditization rebuttal is critical for sophisticated investors: as models become cheaper and interchangeable, the proprietary infrastructure that makes any model enterprise-safe becomes MORE defensible.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: AI as infrastructure not veneer: N+M architecture is proprietary data and integration moat; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: architectural network effects create defensible position; Capital-efficient growth: 6× cheaper than Palantir positions NeuraPlox in a defensible price band; European digital sovereignty: data stays in European cloud or on-premise by design

*Transition: That is what the platform does. Now the layer that makes it enterprise-deployable: governance.*

---

## Slide 5: Governance by Design — The 3D-Policy Moat No One Else Has
*Type: product*

**Every AI agent is a first-class identity with its own permission matrix — governed, not just monitored.**

- 3D-POLICY MODEL: WHO (agent identity, certification tier) × WHAT (data access, actions, inter-agent comms) × WHICH DATA (categories, PII classification). Agents need context-dependent policy, not static roles.
- AUDIT TRAIL: Every agent action traced end-to-end. Input firewall + output control + PII detection targeting >95% precision/recall on German business documents. Compliance dashboards for EU AI Act.
- UNIFIED DATA ACCESS: Bidirectional connectors for Microsoft 365, SAP, DMS — 80% of Mittelstand needs. New connectors added declaratively. Read AND write — unlike analytics-only platforms.
- AGENT REGISTRY: Lifecycle management, permission matrices, 3-tier certification for third-party Ploxe. Open SDK for partners.
- IP: Governance layer proprietary (trade secret). Infrastructure layer open-sourced for adoption. Patent planned post validation.

**Key Metrics:**
- PII detection target: >95% precision and >95% recall on German business documents
- Policy evaluation latency target: <2 seconds for full 4-stage pipeline
- 3-tier agent certification framework — unique in market

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

This is the moat slide. The 3D-Policy Model is the single most defensible piece of IP in the stack — no agent framework, no enterprise platform, and no hyperscaler has built agent-as-identity governance. NeMo Guardrails does input/output filtering; we do agent identity governance. That is a categorically different abstraction. The bidirectionality of L5 is also a key differentiator — analytics platforms like Palantir and Dataiku read data; NeuraPlox agents read AND write, which is required for actual workflow automation. The open/closed IP strategy is deliberate: open the infrastructure to attract developers, close the governance layer where the moat lives.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: AI as infrastructure not veneer: proprietary 3D-Policy Model is architectural moat, not a feature wrapper; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: specific TRL milestones, ISO certifications, patent strategy; European digital sovereignty: DSGVO-compliant PII detection by design, data stays in EU infrastructure; Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: EU AI Act article-specific compliance (Art. 9, 12, 14) shows regulatory depth

*Transition: With the platform and governance clear, here are the agents that prove it works in practice.*

---

## Slide 6: The Agent OS Window Is Open Now
*Type: why-now*

**Regulatory pressure, technology readiness, and proven demand converge in a 12–18 month category-creation window.**

- EU AI ACT CATALYST: Mandatory governance for high-risk AI systems by August 2026. 56% of enterprises see AI Act as burden without a solution.
- LLM COST COLLAPSE: GPT-4 class inference dropped 90%+ since 2023 — agent automation now viable for Mittelstand. Gartner: 40%+ enterprise apps with embedded agents by 2026.
- DEMAND SIGNAL: 25+ consulting projects prove enterprises pay €80K–€150K per project for infrastructure NeuraPlox standardizes.
- SOVEREIGNTY TAILWIND: 93% of German companies prefer German AI providers. BMWK investing €5B+ in AI sovereignty.

**Key Metrics:**
- EU AI Act compliance mandatory: August 2026
- Gartner: 40%+ enterprise apps with embedded agents by 2026
- 93% of German companies prefer German AI providers (Bitkom 2025)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Lead with the regulatory catalyst — August 2026 is a hard deadline and it shortens sales cycles. The LLM cost collapse makes agents economically viable for the Mittelstand, but the infrastructure to run them safely does not exist. Our 25+ consulting projects are the most credible demand signal: real enterprises paying real money. The sovereignty tailwind is unique to a European player. Together these forces create a 12–18 month window where the Agent OS category gets defined.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: explicit timing argument for why the Agent OS category is being created now; European digital sovereignty: BMWK investment and German provider preference create structural moat; AI as infrastructure: regulatory catalyst transforms governance from optional to mandatory infrastructure; Deep tech with commercialization path: LLM cost curves validate now as the commercialization moment

*Transition: These agents are real, proven in 25+ engagements. But don't take our word for it — here is the competitive context.*

---

## Slide 7: We Are Not Competing — We Are Defining a New Category
*Type: competitive-landscape*

**On infrastructure depth × Mittelstand economics, NeuraPlox stands alone. Every other player optimizes for one axis.**

- POSITIONING: Infrastructure depth × Mittelstand economics. NeuraPlox: deep architecture + affordable. Palantir/Dataiku: deep but €48K–€150K+. LangChain/CrewAI: no production path.
- MOAT (4 LAYERS): Architectural (3D-Policy — unique agent identity governance). Network (N+M connector effects). Regulatory (EU AI Act switching costs). Sovereign (German company, EU data).
- VS. EACH CATEGORY: Hyperscalers = lock-in. Enterprise platforms = priced out. Agent frameworks = no governance. Adoption tools = NeuraPlox is the infrastructure they'd run ON.
- COMMODITIZATION: As LLMs commoditize, governance + integration becomes the durable asset. Model-agnostic by design.

**Key Metrics:**
- NeuraPlox entry: €24K/year vs. Palantir €150K+/year (6–10× cheaper)
- vs. Dataiku: 2× cheaper at entry, with agent governance Dataiku cannot provide
- vs. LangChain: production-ready in <6 weeks vs. 3–6 months of custom infrastructure build

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The most important point on this slide is the category creator framing: we are not taking 10% of Palantir's market or 10% of LangChain's user base. We are creating a new market category — the Agent OS — that sits between the application layer (Langdock, Copilot) and the infrastructure layer (Kubernetes, cloud). This positioning is exactly how SAP positioned itself not as better accounting software, but as a new category of enterprise resource planning. The AI commoditization rebuttal is essential for sophisticated investors: our moat is not in the models, it is in the proprietary infrastructure that makes any model safe for enterprise deployment.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: explicit positioning as category creator, not competitor — mirrors Earlybird's UiPath/remberg pattern; AI as infrastructure not veneer: commoditization rebuttal directly addresses Earlybird's AI infrastructure thesis; European digital sovereignty: sovereign moat layer (German company, EU data, ZIM validation) is structural; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: four-layer moat demonstrates defensibility beyond first-mover advantage

*Transition: No one else occupies this position. Here is the traction that validates it.*

---

## Slide 8: 25+ Enterprise Projects, €1M+ Revenue, Four Live Pilots
*Type: traction*

**Consulting-funded PMF, government-validated technology, and measurable customer outcomes across financial services.**

- CUSTOMER ROI: Tax advisory pilot — ML pattern recognition on Jahresabschlussbuchungen cut manual review time by ~40%. Typical customer saves €48K–€90K/year in infrastructure costs vs. rebuilding per project.
- EXPANSION (NDR PROXY): Engagements grow from 1–2 use cases in Year 1 to 4–6 by Year 3 — ~300% ARPU expansion, implying ~150% net dollar retention at platform scale.
- VALIDATION: ZIM grant €237K (45% of €527K). TRL 4→7 in progress. Four pilots with real enterprise data. Financial services vertical beachhead.
- CAPITAL EFFICIENCY: >€1M consulting revenue. 15 people bootstrapped in 2 years. Zero institutional capital. Consulting covers team; ZIM covers R&D.

**Key Metrics:**
- Consulting revenue: >€1M annual run-rate
- NDR proxy: ~150% (1–2 use cases → 4–6 by Year 3, ~300% ARPU expansion)
- Customer ROI: ~40% reduction in manual review time; €48K–€90K/yr infrastructure savings

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Be direct: zero platform ARR, by design. The consulting revenue run-rate (>€1M) proves the team can operate without burning VC capital. The ZIM grant is a credibility signal from Germany's rigorous innovation program. The financial services vertical is the beachhead — the tax advisory pilot with measurable ML accuracy is the strongest case. Frame consulting as R&D lab: every project feeds platform features. The NDR proxy from expansion behavior is a forward indicator of platform retention.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: bootstrapped to 15 people, ZIM grant as non-dilutive R&D co-funding — directly maps to Earlybird's capital efficiency requirement; Named customer evidence with quantified ROI: four anonymized pilot cases with specific outcome descriptions; Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: 25+ real deployments signals genuine vertical depth; AI as infrastructure not veneer: TRL framing (4→7) signals applied engineering, not research

*Transition: Traction is proven. Here is the business model that captures the value.*

---

## Slide 9: Consulting Funds Today, Platform Captures Tomorrow, Marketplace Multiplies
*Type: business-model*

**Three-horizon model: services (30% GM) → platform SaaS (70% GM) → marketplace (80%+ GM). Each horizon de-risks the next.**

- H1 — CONSULTING (NOW, ~30% GM): Bootstrapped to 15 employees. Every engagement funds R&D and generates a future platform customer. Zero-CAC acquisition channel.
- H2 — PLATFORM SaaS (12–18 MO, ~70% GM): €24K–96K ACV. Per-agent, per-connector pricing. 2× cheaper than Dataiku, 6× cheaper than Palantir.
- H3 — MARKETPLACE (24+ MO, ~80%+ GM): 15–25% revenue share on third-party Ploxe. SDK licensing. Certification fees. Scales without proportional headcount.
- UNIT ECONOMICS: Entry €24K → expansion €60K+ by Year 3 (~150% NDR proxy). Implementation <6 weeks. ZIM covers 45% of R&D.
- SUBSTITUTION: NeuraPlox replaces recurring infrastructure rebuilds (€48K–€90K per project). ROI amortizes on Project 1.

**Key Metrics:**
- Entry ACV: €24,000/year | Expansion ACV: €60,000+ by Year 3
- Gross margin trajectory: 30% (consulting) → 70% (SaaS) → 80%+ (marketplace)
- Burn multiple target: <1.5× once platform revenue begins

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

The three-horizon story is critical to combat the 'consulting company trying to productize' objection. Consulting is not the business — it is the R&D lab that paid for the product intuition and funds operations while the platform is built. The ZIM grant structure matters here: 45% of the R&D cost is government-funded, which means the capital efficiency of this raise is exceptional — €2M goes significantly further because €237K of the core R&D is already covered. The marketplace economics are the real prize: once third-party developers build Ploxe on the platform, each new agent makes the platform more valuable without proportional cost increases.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: ZIM grant covers 45% of R&D; consulting revenue offsets burn; burn multiple target <1.5×; Gross margin trajectory: explicitly shown 30%→70%→80%+ — Earlybird's required metric; Category creation: marketplace/ecosystem model creates platform dynamics vs. point solution economics; AI as infrastructure not veneer: substitution (not addition) ROI case validates infrastructure positioning

*Transition: The business model scales. Here is how big the market is.*

---

## Slide 10: Creating the Agent OS Category — €1.5B DACH SAM
*Type: market-sizing*

**70,000 Mittelstand ICPs × 45% AI adoption = 30,000 addressable. SOM Year 3 is <0.2% of SAM — conservative.**

- BOTTOM-UP: 70,000 Mittelstand ICPs, 50–500 employees, DACH (IfM Bonn). AI adoption 36% in 2025 (Bitkom), projected ~45% by 2027. SAM: ~30,000 companies × €50K ACV = ~€1.5B/year.
- SOM YEAR 3: 50 customers × €60K ACV = €3M ARR. <0.2% of SAM — deliberately conservative.
- GLOBAL CONTEXT: AI Platform Market $18.2B → $94B by 2030 (38.9% CAGR). Europe 29–33% share. Agent OS is a new sub-category.
- CATEGORY CREATION: SAP started DACH, won globally. Agent OS: DACH beachhead, European sovereignty as moat, marketplace as international scale mechanism.

**Key Metrics:**
- ICP count: 70,000 companies (IfM Bonn, 50–500 employees, DACH)
- SAM: ~30,000 companies × avg €50K ACV = ~€1.5B/year
- SOM Year 3: €3M ARR (50 customers) = <0.2% of SAM

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Lead with the bottom-up, not the top-down. The €1.5B SAM sounds credible because it is derived from a real ICP count from IfM Bonn, not from a market research report multiplied by a percentage. The SOM is intentionally conservative — less than 0.2% of the addressable market — because defensible numbers matter more than impressive ones. The ARPU expansion story is the NDR driver: customers start small and expand as they deploy more Ploxe. Acknowledge the category creation framing: we are not taking share from Palantir or Dataiku, we are creating a market that did not exist. Category creators win disproportionately — and Earlybird has backed this pattern before.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Category creation: explicit 'Agent OS' as new market category, not share-taking; Capital-efficient growth: bottom-up SOM methodology with <0.2% penetration required — defensible and credible; Global winner potential: SAP/DACH-to-global analogy is specifically relevant for a European VC; European digital sovereignty: DACH beachhead with sovereignty moat is a structural advantage vs. US competitors

*Transition: A €1.5B SAM. Here is how we reach it.*

---

## Slide 11: Land via Consulting, Expand via Platform, Open via Marketplace
*Type: go-to-market*

**Zero wasted acquisition spend — consulting provides warm pipeline at no CAC.**

- ICP: CTOs at Mittelstand companies (50–500 employees, DACH). Triggers: AI project cost overrun, EU AI Act compliance, N×M integration tax.
- PHASE 1 — LAND (Year 1, 10 customers): Convert ZIM pilots. Consulting = warm leads at ~€0 CAC. Financial services vertical focus.
- PHASE 2 — EXPAND (Year 2, 30–50 customers): Self-serve onboarding. 5–10 IT consultancies as certified partners. 1 Plox → 4–6 Ploxe per customer.
- PHASE 3 — OPEN (Year 3+): Marketplace (15–25% rev share). DACH → Austria, Switzerland, Benelux via local SI partners. Platform scales internationally without linear headcount.
- TRUST: 93% of German companies prefer German AI providers. ISO 27001/42001 as procurement differentiator.

**Key Metrics:**
- Year 1 target: 10 paying platform customers, ~€600K ARR
- Year 2 target: 30–50 customers, ~€2.4M ARR
- Sales cycle estimate: 60–90 days (managed service entry)

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Consulting provides zero-cost lead generation. The partner channel (IT consultancies, Systemhäuser) is the scaling mechanism. ISO certification is a hard procurement requirement in regulated German verticals. The land-and-expand motion is architectural: N+M means every new Plox has near-zero marginal integration cost.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: ~€0 CAC for early customers via consulting pipeline; partner channel scales without headcount; European digital sovereignty: 93% German provider preference creates structural sales advantage; Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: sector-specific triggers (EU AI Act, N×M tax) show vertical ICP precision; Global winner potential: DACH land-and-expand → DACH partner ecosystem → international expansion is a proven European playbook

*Transition: The GTM is capital-efficient. Here is the financial trajectory.*

---

## Slide 12: Revenue Trajectory: €600K → €2.4M → €3M+ ARR
*Type: financials*

**Consulting offsets burn today. Platform converts in 12 months. Break-even at ~40–50 customers.**

- TRAJECTORY: Year 1: €600K ARR (10 customers). Year 2: €2.4M ARR (40 customers). Year 3: €3M+ ARR + ecosystem revenue from marketplace.
- BURN PROFILE: Consulting >€1M covers operations. ZIM €237K covers R&D. Burn multiple target: <1.5×. Path to break-even: ~40–50 customers.
- FLYWHEEL: More agents → more connectors → better governance → more trust → more agents. Open architecture = sticky through value, not lock-in.
- INTERNATIONAL SCALE: Marketplace enables DACH → European expansion without proportional headcount. SI partner channel replicates consulting GTM in new markets.

**Key Metrics:**
- Year 1: €600K ARR (10 customers × €60K ACV)
- Break-even: ~40–50 customers (~€2.4–3M ARR)
- Burn multiple target: <1.5× once platform revenue begins

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Lead with the numbers: the revenue trajectory is clear and achievable. Stress the three-layer burn offset: consulting >€1M covers operations, ZIM covers R&D, seed accelerates platform. The flywheel is the long-term growth engine but don't over-index on it here — investors want to see the path to break-even first. The international expansion story is the Series A narrative.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: explicitly targets <1.5× burn multiple and revenue-to-raised near 1:1 — Earlybird's stated requirements; Burn multiple: ZIM grant + consulting revenue creates structural capital efficiency unavailable to competitors; Category creation: revenue trajectory maps to category-creation timing — platform launch in 12 months must precede the EU AI Act deadline; European digital sovereignty: ZIM grant as non-dilutive government validation reinforces European sovereign infrastructure positioning

*Transition: The flywheel is the growth engine. Here is the team that builds it.*

---

## Slide 13: 15 People, 25+ Deployments, Deep Enterprise AI Domain Expertise
*Type: team*

**Two enterprise transformation founders + 13 senior engineers. 25+ real deployments = unfair product intuition.**

- CHRISTOPH KNÖLL (CEO): Ex-PwC Senior Manager Transactions — M&A, IT, KI strategy (double-digit millions EUR). TÜV SÜD Innovator. EU AI Act certified. Enterprise credibility + technical depth.
- SYLVIA KNÖLL (COO): Transformation expertise from Allianz and Oliver Wyman. Led organizational change across financial services.
- ENGINEERING (13): Senior Software Architect (interim platform lead), ML/AI Engineer (RAG + PII), DevOps (K8s + GitOps), NLP/ML Specialist, Security Engineer. All 5+ years.
- UNFAIR ADVANTAGE: 25+ real deployments — financial services vertical depth from tax advisory, due diligence, bookkeeping automation. Consulting experience IS product intuition.
- CTO HIRE: Priority #1. Profile: K8s/distributed systems + platform product. Active search with Q2 2026 target. Senior Architect leads platform engineering until hire closes.

**Key Metrics:**
- 15-person team, bootstrapped in 2 years
- 25+ enterprise KI projects: Due Diligence AI, order automation, care worker placement, warehouse logistics
- Combined enterprise transformation experience: PwC, Allianz, Oliver Wyman

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

Lead with the consulting experience as unfair advantage — 25+ real deployments with depth in financial services. The CTO search is active with a Q2 2026 target; the Senior Architect provides interim technical leadership. Investors respect self-awareness plus a plan over pretending the gap doesn't exist.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Industrial/enterprise domain expertise: PwC M&A/IT strategy + Allianz/Oliver Wyman transformation = exactly Earlybird's founder profile preference; Capital-efficient growth: bootstrapped to 15 people signals resourcefulness and product discipline; Deep tech with clear commercialization path: 25+ real deployments is the commercialization track record; European digital sovereignty: German founders, German enterprise experience, German regulatory expertise (EU AI Act certified)

*Transition: This team has the domain expertise. Here is what the raise funds.*

---

## Slide 14: €2,000,000 Seed Round — One Number, Defended
*Type: the-ask*

**€2M funds platform launch, CTO hire, and first 10 paying customers — Series A proof points in 18 months.**

- THE ASK: €2,000,000 Seed. ZIM (€237K) covers 45% of core R&D. Consulting offsets operations. Effective runway: 24+ months.
- USE OF FUNDS: (1) CTO + 2–3 engineers — 50%. (2) Platform GA launch — 30%. (3) SDK + Marketplace beta — 20%.
- 18-MONTH MILESTONES: Platform GA with pilots live. 10 paying customers. Marketplace beta. ISO readiness. €600K ARR.
- WHY NOW: Without this raise, platform launches 12+ months slower — risking category window. EU AI Act August 2026 creates urgency.
- SERIES A BRIDGE: €600K ARR + 10 customers + marketplace beta = metrics for €10–15M raise.

**Key Metrics:**
- Raise: €2,000,000 (one number)
- 18-month target: €600K ARR, 10 paying platform customers
- Series A bridge: €3–5M ARR target, €10–15M raise

<details>
<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

One number — €2M — and defend it precisely. The ZIM grant structure is the killer argument for capital efficiency: 45% of the core R&D is already funded by the German government, so this raise goes significantly further than its face value. The CTO hire as 50% of use-of-funds is a signal of operational self-awareness — founders who know exactly what they need to hire next are significantly less risky than those who spread hiring across undefined roles. The Series A bridge is explicit: €600K ARR with 10 named customers and marketplace beta are the metrics that get a European enterprise infrastructure company to Series A. Close with the urgency argument: without this raise, the category-creation window starts to close.

</details>

> **VC Alignment**: Capital-efficient growth: ZIM grant leverage means €2M provides >€2M effective capital; consulting offset means no pure burn clock; Clear commercialization path: 18-month milestones explicitly bridge to Series A metrics; Category creation: 'category-creation window' framing creates urgency without hype; European digital sovereignty: ISO certifications and EU AI Act compliance position NeuraPlox as the sovereign infrastructure partner

*Transition: That is the ask. One final thought on why this matters for Europe.*

---

## Slide 15: The Open AI OS for Europe — Built Here, Governed Here, Sovereign Here
*Type: ai-architecture*

**Every enterprise will run AI agents. The question is ON WHAT. Open. Governed. European.**

- THE CATEGORY MOMENT: SAP defined enterprise operations. Salesforce defined CRM. NeuraPlox defines the Agent OS — governance, integration, orchestration between raw AI models and enterprise workflows.
- EUROPEAN SOVEREIGNTY BY ARCHITECTURE: Cloud-agnostic, DSGVO-compliant PII detection, EU AI Act governance as product feature. Open standards at infrastructure layer, proprietary governance at value layer.
- THE MOAT IS THE OS: As AI models commoditize, the infrastructure making any model enterprise-safe is the durable asset. 3D-Policy, N+M connectors, agent registry — architecture-level IP.
- PATH IS PROVEN: SAP from Walldorf, remberg from Munich, HiveMQ from Landshut — European deep tech built on domain expertise wins globally.
- THE OPPORTUNITY: €2M Seed. €237K ZIM secured. 25+ deployments. 15 people. EU AI Act tailwind. 93% German provider preference. kontakt@neurawork.de

**Key Metrics:**
- Global AI Platform Market: $18.2B → $94B by 2030 (38.9% CAGR)
- 93% of German companies prefer German AI providers (Bitkom 2025)
- BMWK investing €5B+ in AI and digital sovereignty infrastructure

<summary>Speaker Notes</summary>

End with vision and emotion, not technology. The investor should leave this room thinking about category creation and European sovereignty — not architecture layers. The SAP, Salesforce, Shopify analogies are not hubris — they are the category-creation pattern that Earlybird has backed repeatedly. The Earlybird portfolio framing (remberg, HiveMQ, Aleph Alpha) is intentional: NeuraPlox fits the thesis. The closing visual should be clean: the bold statement — 'Open. Governed. European.' — and the contact. Do not put another architecture diagram on the last slide. End with the call to action and the belief that Europe can and should own this infrastructure layer.

> **VC Alignment**: European digital sovereignty: this slide IS the sovereignty thesis — built here, governed here, data stays here; Category creation: explicit category creation moment framing — the Agent OS as the next major enterprise software category; Global winner potential: DACH-to-global path explicitly referenced with European deep tech precedents; Capital-efficient growth: ZIM grant + consulting revenue + precise use-of-funds = Earlybird's capital efficiency thesis embodied

*Transition: This is the end of the formal presentation. We welcome your questions — and we have a data room ready.*

## Information Gaps

The following data points were missing and could strengthen the deck:

- [ ] Platform ARR = 0 — by design; consulting revenue >€1M and ZIM grant fund operations and R&D
- [ ] No signed platform contracts yet — four LOIs from ZIM pilots, conversion expected post-platform GA
- [ ] CTO hire in progress — active search targeting Q2 2026; Senior Architect leads platform engineering interim
- [ ] NDR proxy (~150%) derived from consulting expansion behavior — direct platform NDR data pending post-launch
- [ ] Exact consulting revenue figure >€1M disclosed as floor; detailed financials available in data room
