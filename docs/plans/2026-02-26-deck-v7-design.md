# NeuraPlox Deck v7 — Design Document

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** Approved
**Approach:** A — Platform-OS Lead (SAP analogy)
**Target:** Earlybird profile, Score >= 90/100

---

## 1. Core Narrative & Throughline

**One-liner:** "NeuraPlox is the AI Operating System for enterprises — where agents auto-create their own IT interfaces and governance makes it production-safe. SAP for the AI era."

### Narrative Arc

| Act | Slides | Job | Emotional Beat |
|-----|--------|-----|----------------|
| I — The Problem | 1-2 | Establish urgency | "This is broken and getting worse" |
| II — The Vision | 3-5 | Paint the future, show the OS | "This is what it should look like" |
| III — The Proof | 6-8 | Agents + traction prove it's real | "They're already doing it" |
| IV — The Business | 9-12 | Market, model, GTM, growth | "This is a massive opportunity" |
| V — The Team & Ask | 13-15 | People, money, close | "These are the people to bet on" |

### Three Repeating Messages

1. **"Agents need an OS, not more tools"** — the category insight (Problem, Vision, Market)
2. **"Governance is the unlock"** — without it, nothing goes to production. This is the moat. (Platform, Traction, Why-Us)
3. **"Consulting is the lab, Platform is the product, Marketplace is the multiplier"** — the business evolution (Business Model, Growth, Ask)

### SAP Analogy Usage

- SAP unified fragmented enterprise operations into one system -> NeuraPlox unifies fragmented AI agents into one OS
- SAP's moat was deep enterprise integration -> NeuraPlox's moat is N+M architecture (agents auto-create connectors)
- SAP built an ecosystem of partners/modules -> NeuraPlox builds a marketplace of third-party agents
- Used once explicitly on the Vision slide (slide 3), then referenced subtly — framing device, not the whole pitch

### Anti-Pattern

v6 led with architecture (7 layers) and stayed technical. v7 leads with what the architecture enables — the "so what" for the enterprise buyer and the investor.

## 2. Slide-by-Slide Content Design

### Slide 1 — Cover

- "NeuraPlox — The AI Operating System for Enterprises"
- Subtitle: "Where agents build their own interfaces. Governance-safe by design."
- Clean, no clutter. Logo, tagline, round info.

### Slide 2 — Problem

- **Kernaussage:** "Enterprise AI is stuck between PoC and production"
- 3 pain points: (1) Every agent project is custom integration hell, (2) No governance = no compliance = no deployment, (3) Point solutions create vendor lock-in — the "Suesses Gift" trap
- Data point from Antrag v9: market stats on failed enterprise AI projects
- *Earlybird: European digital sovereignty (US lock-in pain), AI as infrastructure not veneer (PoC graveyard)*

### Slide 3 — Vision: "SAP for the AI Era"

- **Kernaussage:** "One OS where any agent connects to any system — automatically"
- SAP analogy: SAP unified operations -> NeuraPlox unifies AI agents
- Visual: before (spaghetti of point solutions) vs. after (OS layer with agents on top)
- Introduce N+M: N agents x M systems, agents auto-create their connectors
- *Earlybird: Category creation, Deep tech with commercialization path*

### Slide 4 — Platform: The N+M Architecture

- **Kernaussage:** "N agents x M systems — without NxM integrations"
- How it works: agents declare intent, platform resolves connectors, governance gates execution
- The moat: every new agent makes every connector more valuable, every new connector makes every agent more capable
- Keep it functional, not layer-by-layer — what it does, not how it's built
- *Earlybird: Deep tech, AI as infrastructure*

### Slide 5 — Governance: The Production Unlock

- **Kernaussage:** "Without governance, nothing goes to production. We solve that."
- 3 pillars: compliance (DSGVO, AI Act), auditability (every agent action traceable), control (human-in-the-loop where needed)
- "Operational AI = 50% Tech, 50% Mensch" — enterprises need the human layer
- This is what makes NeuraPlox enterprise-deployable vs. every other agent framework
- *Earlybird: European digital sovereignty, Industrial/enterprise domain expertise*

### Slide 6 — Showcase Agents: Intelligence Suite

- **Kernaussage:** "We don't just build the OS — we ship the killer apps"
- 3 agents: Market Intelligence (replaces market research consultants), Marketing Intelligence (replaces marketing agencies), Vertriebs Intelligence (replaces sales ops teams)
- Each: one sentence what it replaces, one metric on efficiency gain
- Source: 25+ real consulting engagements — not hypothetical
- *Earlybird: AI as infrastructure not veneer (agents do real work)*

### Slide 7 — Prism Agent Flow: Operations as a Service

- **Kernaussage:** "Entire consulting functions — replaced by agent workflows"
- Prism Flow replaces: tax advisor workflows, accounts payable, bookkeeping — all AI-native
- Shopify analogy: Shopify let anyone run an online store -> Prism lets any enterprise run AI operations
- "50% Tech, 50% Mensch" in action — agents do the work, humans govern
- *Earlybird: Category creation (new delivery model)*

### Slide 8 — Traction & Validation

- **Kernaussage:** "25+ enterprise projects, 15-person team, ZIM-funded platform development"
- Key numbers: projects delivered, team size, grant funding secured
- Honest framing: "Consulting is our R&D lab — every project feeds platform features"
- Customer logos/sectors if available from Antrag v9
- Address ARR gap head-on: "Current revenue is consulting. Platform launch [timeline]. This raise funds the transition."
- *Earlybird: Capital-efficient growth (grant-funded R&D)*

### Slide 9 — Business Model: The Three Horizons

- **Kernaussage:** "Consulting funds today, Platform captures tomorrow, Marketplace multiplies"
- H1 (now): Consulting revenue — proves demand, funds R&D
- H2 (next 12-18mo): Platform SaaS — per-agent, per-connector pricing
- H3 (24mo+): Marketplace — revenue share on third-party agents
- Margin expansion: consulting (~30%) -> SaaS (~70%) -> marketplace (~80%+)
- *Earlybird: Capital-efficient growth*

### Slide 10 — Market: The Agent OS Category

- **Kernaussage:** "The Agent OS market doesn't exist yet — we're creating it"
- TAM/SAM/SOM from Antrag v9 data
- Category creation argument: not competing in "AI tools" — defining "Agent OS"
- Adjacent markets being disrupted: enterprise middleware, consulting, RPA
- *Earlybird: Category creation, Global winner potential (category creators win globally)*

### Slide 11 — GTM: Land, Expand, Open

- **Kernaussage:** "Land via consulting, expand via platform, open via marketplace"
- Phase 1: Consulting relationships -> convert to platform customers (warm pipeline)
- Phase 2: Self-serve platform for mid-market
- Phase 3: Marketplace — third-party agents and SIs onboard themselves
- Flywheel: more agents -> more data -> better governance -> more trust -> more agents
- *Earlybird: Global winner potential (marketplace scales without linear headcount)*

### Slide 12 — Growth: The Ecosystem Flywheel

- **Kernaussage:** "Network effects make this a winner-take-most market"
- Flywheel visual: agents <-> connectors <-> data <-> governance <-> trust <-> more agents
- Anti-"Suesses Gift": open architecture means no lock-in — but ecosystem is sticky
- International expansion: platform + marketplace scale beyond DACH without proportional team growth
- SAP started DACH -> went global. Same playbook, AI-native.
- *Earlybird: Global winner potential from European base*

### Slide 13 — Team

- **Kernaussage:** "15 people, deep enterprise AI + domain expertise"
- Full team from Antrag v9 — not just founders, all 15
- Domain expertise: consulting backgrounds that built the agent knowledge
- CTO gap: "Hiring platform-scale CTO is priority #1 for this raise"
- *Earlybird: Industrial/enterprise domain expertise*

### Slide 14 — The Ask

- **Kernaussage:** Specific amount (from Antrag v9 financials), specific milestones
- Use of funds: (1) CTO + engineering scale, (2) Platform launch, (3) First marketplace agents
- Milestones: Platform GA, first 10 paying platform customers, marketplace beta
- No range — one number, defended.

### Slide 15 — Closing: "The Open AI OS for Europe"

- **Kernaussage:** "Openness is our strategic advantage — the anti-sweet-poison"
- Circle back to European sovereignty — this is Europe's AI OS
- Bold closing statement, not an architecture diagram (v6 mistake)
- *Earlybird: European digital sovereignty, Global winner from European base*

## 3. Gap Remediation Strategy

How v7 fixes all 9 critical gaps from v6 validation.

| # | v6 Gap | v7 Fix | Slide |
|---|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Zero confirmed platform ARR | Head-on: "Consulting is revenue today. This raise funds the platform transition." Frame as strength — R&D funded by real customers, not burn. | 8, 9 |
| 2 | No CTO with platform-scale experience | Address directly: "CTO hire is priority #1 for this raise." Sketch the profile. Shows self-awareness, not weakness. | 13, 14 |
| 3 | Global winner potential absent (DACH-only) | Triple fix: (1) SAP analogy — DACH->Global is proven path, (2) Marketplace scales internationally without linear headcount, (3) Slide 12 dedicated to flywheel + international. | 3, 11, 12 |
| 4 | All slides exceed word limits by 50-200% | Hard rule: max 80 words per slide body. Less architecture detail, more "so what". Each slide has ONE core message. | All |
| 5 | Over-indexing on architecture vs. business proof | Architecture is now ONE slide (4) instead of three. Described functionally (what it does), not structurally (how it's built). 7 of 15 slides are business (8-14). | 4 vs. 8-14 |
| 6 | No NDR/retention metrics | Honest: doesn't exist yet (no platform ARR). Proxy metrics from consulting instead: repeat engagement rate, project expansion. Pull from Antrag v9 if available. | 8 |
| 7 | No quantified customer ROI case study | Pull strongest case from 25+ consulting projects. One concrete example: "Customer X, Process Y, Z% efficiency gain." Must be in Antrag v9 or ZIM data. | 6 or 8 |
| 8 | Raise amount "3-5M to be confirmed" | Concrete number. Derive from Antrag v9 financial planning. No range, one figure. | 14 |
| 9 | AI architecture slide (15) disrupts closing momentum | Architecture moved forward (slide 4). Closing is now emotional: sovereignty + vision + bold statement. | 4 vs. 15 |

**Principle:** Don't hide weaknesses — reframe them. "No ARR" becomes "customers fund our R&D." "No CTO" becomes "we know exactly who we need — that's what the raise is for." Investors respect honesty with a plan over obfuscation.

## 4. Earlybird Thesis Coverage

| Thesis Point | Primary Slide | Secondary Slides | How It Lands |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. European digital sovereignty | 5 (Governance) | 2 (US lock-in problem), 15 (Closing) | Governance + AI Act compliance = European answer to US platform dominance. Closing circles back: "The Open AI OS for Europe." |
| 2. Category creation | 10 (Market) | 3 (SAP analogy), 7 (Prism: new delivery model) | Don't fit into existing category. "Agent OS" is the new category. TAM derived bottom-up from markets being disrupted. |
| 3. Capital-efficient growth | 9 (Business Model) | 8 (ZIM-funded traction) | Consulting revenue funds R&D. ZIM grant de-risked platform development. No burn without counter-financing. |
| 4. AI as infrastructure, not veneer | 4 (N+M Architecture) | 6 (Agents do real work), 2 (PoC graveyard problem) | Agents replace entire functions, not a feature on top. Platform is the foundation, not a GPT wrapper. |
| 5. Deep tech with commercialization path | 4 (N+M Architecture) | 9 (Three Horizons) | N+M is genuine deep tech (auto-generated connectors). Commercialization is clear: consulting proves demand -> platform monetizes -> marketplace scales. |
| 6. Global winner from European base | 12 (Ecosystem Flywheel) | 11 (GTM: marketplace scales internationally), 3 (SAP: DACH->Global) | Weakest point in v6, now triple-addressed. SAP as proof DACH->Global works. Marketplace as mechanism that scales without linear headcount. |
| 7. Industrial/enterprise domain expertise | 13 (Team) | 5 (Governance from practice), 8 (25+ projects) | 15 people with real enterprise background. Domain knowledge from consulting is the unfair advantage — no other agent startup has seen 25+ enterprise deployments. |

### Earlybird Validator Keyword Coverage

## 5. Technical Execution

### Step 1 — Prepare Input

Rewrite `neuraplox_deck.json` from scratch based on this design. Not patching v6 — clean start. JSON structure follows `DeckInput` model from `models.py`. All 15 slides with core message, bullet points, speaker notes. Hard 80-word limit per slide body.

### Step 2 — Generate Narrative

`pitchdeck generate` with the new input against Earlybird profile. Claude generates the full narrative. Output: `deck.md` + `deck.json` in `output/neuraplox/v7/`.

### Step 3 — Validate

`pitchdeck validate` against `profiles/earlybird.yaml`. Target: score >= 90/100 (v6 was 84). All 7 thesis keywords must match. No "critical" gaps.

### Step 4 — Iterate

Analyze validation result -> adjust input -> regenerate -> revalidate. Maximum 3 iterations. If < 85 after 3 rounds, prioritize gaps and fix manually.

### Output Structure

```
output/neuraplox/v7/
  deck.md              — Final deck (Markdown)
  deck.json            — Structured deck data
  validation_report.md — Earlybird validation
```

### What We Don't Do

- No new code — the tool exists and works
- No new VC profiles — Earlybird is sufficient
- No changes to models.py or engine — pure content work
